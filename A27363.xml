            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>IF Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi> had not told us, That this is a <hi>moſt profitable Controverſie;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Controv. T. <hi>2.</hi> L. <hi>4</hi> de Notis Eccleſiae.</note> I ſhould very much have wondered at that pains which he and ſo many other of their great Divines have taken, to find out the Notes of the Church. For is not the Catholick Church viſible? And if we can ſee which is this Church, what need we gueſs at it by marks and ſigns? and that by ſuch marks and ſigns too, as are matter of diſpute themſelves? Cannot we diſtinguiſh between the Chriſtian Church, and a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Moſque, or <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Synagogue, or Pagan Temple? Cannot we, without all this ado, diſtinguiſh a Chriſtian from a <hi>Turk,</hi> or a <hi>Jew,</hi> or a Pagan? And it will be as eaſie to find out a Chriſtian Church, as it is to find out Chriſtians; for a Chriſtian Church is nothing elſe but a Society of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians united under Chriſtian Paſtors, for the Worſhip of Chriſt; and where ever we find ſuch a Society as this, there is a Chriſtian Church, and all ſuch particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar or National Churches all the World over, make up the whole Chriſtian Church, or the Univerſal Church of Chriſt.</p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:104627:21"/>
                  <p>But this will not do the Cardinal's buſineſs; Though the Chriſtian Church is viſible enough, yet not ſuch a Church as he wants. For ſince there are a great many Chriſtian Churches in the World, as the <hi>Greek,</hi> the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian,</hi> the <hi>Abyſſine,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, he would find out which of theſe Churches is the Catholick Church; which after all their ſhuffles they can never make any better ſenſe of, than which of the Parts is the Whole.</p>
                  <p>Since there are many unhappy diſputes among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, the uſe of Notes is to find out an Infallible Church, which muſt by an indiſputable authority di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate to all other Churches, what they muſt believe, and what they muſt practiſe; and to bring all other Churches into ſubjection, they muſt find out a Church, out of whoſe Communion there is no pardon of ſin, no Eternal life to be had. That is, in ſhort, the uſe of Notes is to prove the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the only Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, the only Infallible Oracle of Faith, and final Judg of Controverſies; and that the promiſes of Pardon of Sin, and Eternal Life, are made only to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to thoſe other Churches which are in ſubjection to her. Thus <hi>Bellarmine</hi> unriddles this matter, that the uſefulneſs of this Inquiry after the Notes of the true Church, is, becauſe <hi>in the true Church only there is the true Faith, the true remiſſion of ſins, the true hope of eternal ſalvation;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Omnes enim <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>onfitentur in ſolâ verâ Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia eſſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram fidem, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram peccato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum remiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, veram ſpem ſalutis aeternâ. <hi>Bell.</hi> de Notis Eccl. <hi>cap. 1.</hi>
                     </note> which is certainly true, that all this is to be had only in the true Church of Chriſt. For there can be no true Church without the true Faith; and no remiſſion of ſins, nor hope of ſalvation out of the true Church. But then all the Churches in the World, which profeſs the true faith of Chriſt, are ſuch true Churches. But this will not do the buſineſs neither; for it is not enough to know that every true Church
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104627:21"/>profeſſes the true Faith; but we muſt find out ſuch a Church, as cannot err in the Faith, and has authority to correct the Faith of all other Churches; and we muſt allow the pardon of ſin, and eternal life, to be had in no other Church but this; which is the only thing, which can make ſuch a Church the Miſtreſs of all other Churches; and this Church muſt be the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or elſe the Cardinal is undone with all his Notes and Marks of the Church.</p>
                  <p>The obſerving this, gives us the true ſtate of this Controverſie; which is not, what it is which makes a Church a true Church; which is neceſſary for all Chriſtians to know, that they may take care, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be wanting in their Communion, which is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to a true Church; which is the only uſe of Notes that I know of: but the diſpute is, how among all the diviſions of Chriſtendom, we may find out that only true Church, which is the Miſtreſs of all other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the only Infallible Guide in Matters of Faith, and to which alone the promiſes of pardon and ſalvation are made; and by ſome Notes and Characters of ſuch a Church, to prove, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is that Church. The firſt of theſe is what the Proteſtants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in thoſe Notes they give of the true Church; to ſhow what it is which is eſſential to the being and conſtitution of a Chriſtian Church; for that, and none elſe, is a true Church, which has all things eſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ential to a true Church. The ſecond is, what the <hi>Papiſts</hi> intend by their Notes of a Church; to prove, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the only true Church: and ſome brief remarks upon both theſe ways, will abundantly ſerve for an Introduction to a more particular examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Notes of the Church,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104627:22"/>which is the only deſign of theſe Papers.</p>
                  <p>It is no wonder, that <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> differ ſo much about the Notes of the true Church, ſince the queſtions, which each of them intend to anſwer by their ſeveral Notes, ſo vaſtly differ. When you ask a Proteſtant, What are the Notes of a true Church? He anſwers to that queſtion, What it is, which is eſſential to a true Church; or what it is, which makes a Church a true Church; that is, <hi>What a true Church is?</hi> And examines the truth of his Church by the eſſential marks and properties of a Church. When you ask a <hi>Papiſt</hi> for Notes of a true Church, he anſwers to that queſtion, <hi>Which is a true Church?</hi> and thinks to point you out to a true Church by ſome external marks and ſigns, without ever inquiring what it is, which is eſſential to a Church; and this he muſt of neceſſity do, according to his principles; for he can know nothing of Religion till he has found the Church, from which he muſt learn every thing elſe. Let us conſider then which of theſe is moſt reaſonable.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To begin with the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> way of finding out the Church by the eſſential properties of a true Church; Such as the profeſſion of the true Chriſtian Faith, and the Chriſtian Sacraments rightly and duly adminiſtred by perſons rightly ordained, according to the Inſtitution of our Saviour, and the Apoſtolical pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe. This is eſſential to a true Church; for there can be no true Chriſtian Church without the true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith, and Chriſtian Sacraments, which cannot be rightly adminiſtred but by Church-Officers rightly and duly Ordained. The Regular Exerciſe of Diſcipline is not neceſſary to the being of the Church, but to the purity and good government of it.</p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:104627:22"/>
                  <p>This is the ſum of what the Proteſtants alledg for the Notes of the true Church, and theſe are as infallible Notes of a true Church, as Humane Nature is of a man; for they are the Eſſential Principles of it. By this every man may know whether he be a Member of a true Church or not; for where this is, there is a true Church; where this is not, there is no true Church, whatever other marks of a Church there be. And I know no other uſe of Notes, but to find out what we ſeek for.</p>
                  <p>In anſwer to ſuch Notes as theſe, Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi> objects Three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Notes, whereby we will diſtinguiſh things, muſt not be common to other things, but proper and peculiar to that of which it is a Note. As if you would deſcribe a man to me, whom I never ſaw, ſo as that I may know him when I meet him; it is not enough to ſay, that he has two Hands, or two Eyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe this is common to all Men. And this he ſays is the Fault of theſe Notes: for as for <hi>the ſincere Preaching of the Truth,</hi> or the Profeſſion of the true Chriſtian Faith, this is common to all Sects, at leaſt, in their own Opinion; and the ſame may be ſaid of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. All Sects and Profeſſions of Chriſtians, either have the true Faith and Sacraments, or at leaſt think that they have ſo; and therefore theſe marks cannot vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly diſtinguiſh the true Church from any other Sect of Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>Now I muſt confeſs, theſe Notes, as he well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, are common to all Chriſtian Churches, and were intended to be ſo: and if this does not anſwer his Deſign, we cannot help it. The Proteſtant
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104627:23"/>Churches do not deſire to confine the Notes of the Church to their own private Communions; but are very glad, if all the Churches in the World be as true Churches as themſelves. The whole Catholick Church, which conſiſts of a great many particular Dioceſan, or National Churches, has the ſame Nature; And when the whole conſiſts of univocal parts, every part muſt have the ſame Nature with the whole: And therefore as he who would deſcribe a man, muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe him by ſuch Characters as fit all Mankind; ſo he who gives the Eſſential Characters of a Church, muſt give ſuch Notes as fit all true Churches in the World. This indeed does not fit the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to make it the only Catholick, and the only true Church, nor do we intend it ſhould; but it fits all true Churches, wherever they are, and that is much better.</p>
                  <p>To anſwer then his Argument, when we give Notes, which belong to a whole Species, as we muſt do, when we give the Notes of a true Chriſtian Church; (there being a great many true Churches in the World, which make up the Catholick, or Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church) we muſt give ſuch Notes as belong to the whole kind; that is, to all true Chriſtian Churches. And though theſe Notes are common indeed to all true Chriſtian Churches, yet they are proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to a true Chriſtian Church; as the Eſſential Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of a man are common to all men, but proper to mankind: And this is neceſſary to make them true Notes; For ſuch Notes of a true Church, as do not fit all true Churches, cannot be true Notes.</p>

                  <p>As for what the Cardinal urges, That all Sects of Chriſtians think themſelves to have the true Faith, and true Sacraments; I am apt to think they do; but what then? If they have not the true Faith, and true Sacraments, they are not true Churches, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they think of it; and yet the true Faith, and true Sacraments, are certain Notes of a true Church. A Purchaſe upon a bad Title, which a man thinks a good one, is not a good Eſtate; but yet a Purchaſe upon a Title, which is not only thought to be, but is a good one, is a good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. All that can be ſaid in this caſe, is, That men can be no more certain, that they have a true Church, than they are, that they have a true Faith, and true Sacraments; and this I readily grant. But as mens miſtakes in this matter, does not prove, that there is no true Faith, nor true Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; ſo neither does it prove, that a true Faith, and true Sacraments, are not Notes of the true Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Cardinal's ſecond Objection is, That the Notes of any thing muſt be more known than the thing it ſelf; which we readily grant. Now ſays he, which is the true Church, is more knowable than which is the true Faith: and this we deny, and that for a very plain reaſon, becauſe the true Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be known without knowing the true Faith: for no Church is a true Church, which does not profeſs the true Faith. We may as well ſay, that we can know a Horſe, without knowing what the ſhape and figure of a Horſe is, which diſtinguiſhes it from all other Creatures, as that we can know a Chriſtian Church, without knowing what the Chriſtian Faith
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:104627:24"/>is, which diſtinguiſhes it from all other Churches: or we may as well ſay, that we can know any thing without knowing what it is, ſince the very Eſſence of a true Church conſiſts in the true Faith, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be firſt known before we can know the true Church.</p>
                  <p>But the Cardinal urges, that we cannot know what true Scripture is, nor what is the true interpretation of Scripture, but from the Church; and therefore we muſt know the Church before we can koow the true Faith. As for the firſt, I readily grant, that at this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the writing the Books of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there is no way to aſſure us, that they were written by the Apoſtles, or Apoſtolical men, and owned for inſpired Writings, but the Teſtimony of the Church in all Ages. But herein we do not conſider them as a Church, but as credible Witneſſes. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any ſuch thing as a Church, or not, we can know only by the Scriptures: But without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether there be a Church or not, if we know, that for ſo many Hundred years, theſe Books have been owned to be written by ſuch men, and have been received from the Apoſtles days till now, by all who call themſelves Chriſtians; this is as good an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical Proof as we can have for any thing; and it is the Authority of an uninterrupted Tradition, not the Authority of the Church, conſidered as a Church, which moves us to believe them: For ſetting aſide the Authority of Tradition, how can the Authority of a Company of men, who call themſelves the Church, before I know whether there be any Church, move me to believe any thing which was done 1600. years a-go? But there is a Company of men in the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:104627:24"/>World, and have been ſucceſſively for 1600. years (whether they be a Church or not, is nothing to this queſtion), who aſſure me, that theſe Books, which we call the Scriptures, were written by ſuch inſpired men, and contain a faithful account of what Chriſt did, and taught, and ſuffered; and therefore I believe ſuch Books: and from them I learn what that true Faith is which makes a true Chriſtian Church.</p>
                  <p>As for the true interpretation of Scripture, that we cannot underſtand what it is, without the Church, this I alſo deny. The Scriptures are very intelligible to honeſt and diligent Readers, in all things neceſſary to ſalvation: and if they be not, I deſire to know, how we ſhall find out the Church: for certainly the Church has no Character but what is in the Scripture: and then if we muſt believe the Church before we can believe or underſtand the Scriptures, we muſt believe the Church, before we can poſſibly know whether there be a Church or not. If we prove the Church by the Scripture, we muſt believe and underſtand the Scripture, before we can know the Church: If we believe and underſtand the Scriptures upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Interpretation of the Church, conſidered as a Church, then we muſt know the Church before the Scripture. The Scripture cannot be known with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Church, nor the Church without the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and yet one of them muſt be known firſt, and yet neither of them can be known firſt, according to theſe Principles, which is ſuch an abſurdity, as all the Art of the World can never palliate.</p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:104627:25"/>
                  <p n="3">3. The Cardinal's third Objection is, That the true Notes of the Church muſt be inſeparable from it; whereas the Churches of <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Galatia</hi> did not always teach true Doctrine, ſome of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> denying the Reſurrection, and the <hi>Galatians</hi> warping towards <hi>Judaiſm;</hi> and the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> being guilty of great miſcarriages in receiving the Lords-Supper; and yet were owned for true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches by the Apoſtles. An argument which much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Cardinal to uſe, it being the beſt evidence I know of for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> being a true Church, that every corruption in Faith and Sacraments do not Unchurch; but how this proves that true Faith and true Sacraments are not an eſſential note and character of a true Church, I cannot gueſs: I would deſire any one to tell me for him, whether a corrupt Faith and falſe Sacraments be the Notes of a true Church; or whether it be no matter as to the nature of a Church, what our Faith and Sacraments are?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Let us now conſider the Cardinal's way, by ſome certain marks and notes, to find out which is the true Church, before we know what a true Church is. To pick out of all the Churches in the World, one Church, which we muſt own for the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true Church, and reject all other Churches, which do not ſubject themſelves to this one Church. To find out ſuch a Church on whoſe authority we muſt rely for the whole Chriſtian Faith; and in whoſe Communion only pardon of ſin is to be had. That this is the uſe of Notes in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I have already ſhewn you; and truly they are very pretty things to be proved by Notes; as to conſider them particularly,</p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:104627:25"/>
                  <p n="1">1. To find out which is the true Church, before we know what a true Church is. This methinks is not a natural way of inquiry, but is like ſeeking for we know not what. There are two inquiries in order of nature before <hi>which is the true Church,</hi> viz. Whether there be a true Church or not, and what it is. The firſt of theſe the Cardinal takes for granted, that there is a Church; but I wont take it for granted, but deſire theſe Note-makers to give me ſome Notes to prove, that there is a Church. There is indeed a great deal of talk and noiſe in the World about a Church, but that is no proof, that there is a Church; and yet it is not a ſelf-evident propoſition, that there is a Church; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be proved. Now that there is a Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> muſt be proved by Notes, as well as which is this true Church, or elſe the whole deſign of Notes is loſt; and I would gladly ſee thoſe Notes, which prove that there is a Church, before we know what a Church is. To underſtand the myſtery of this, we muſt briefly conſider the reaſon and uſe of Notes in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> according to the Popiſh reſolution of Faith into the authority of the Church; the firſt thing we muſt know, is, which is the True Church; for we muſt receive the Scriptures, and the Interpretation of them, and the whole Chriſtian Faith and Worſhip, from the Church; and therefore can know nothing of Religion, till we have found the Church. The uſe then of Notes is to find out the Church before, and without the Scriptures; for if they admit of a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-proof, they muſt allow that we can know and underſtand the Scriptures without the authority or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the Church, which undermines the very foundation of Popery: Now I firſt deſire to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104627:26"/>know how they will prove, That there is a Church without the Scripture? That you'l ſay is viſible it ſelf, for we ſee a Chriſtian Church in the World; but what is it I ſee? I ſee a company of men who call themſelves a Church, and this is all that I can ſee; and is this ſeeing a Church? A Church muſt have a Divine Original and Inſtitution; and therefore, there is no ſeeing a Church without ſeeing its Character; for there can be no other Note or Mark of the being of a Church, but the Inſtitution of it.</p>
                  <p>And this proves, that we cannot know, that there is a Church, without knowing in ſome meaſure what this Church is; for the Charter which founds the Church, muſt declare the Nature and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, what its Faith and Worſhip, and Laws and Priviledges are. But now theſe eſſential Characters of a Church muſt not be reckoned by the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> among the Notes of a Church, for then we muſt find out the true Church by the true Faith, and the true Worſhip; not the true Faith by the true Church; which deſtroys Popery.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is, that theſe Note-makers never attempt to give us any Notes, whereby we ſhall know that there is a Church, or what this Church is; for there are no Notes of theſe, but ſuch as they dare not give, <hi>viz.</hi> The Authority of the Scriptures, and every mans private judgment of the Senſe and Interpretation of them; for at leaſt till we have found a Church, we muſt judg for our ſelves, and then the Authority of the Church comes too late; for we muſt firſt judg upon the whole of Religion, if we muſt find out a true Church by the true Faith, before we can know the true Church; and we cannot rely on her Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104627:26"/>before we know her; and therefore they take it for granted, that there is a Church, which they can never prove in their way, and attempt to give ſome Notes whereby to know which is the Church; and then learn, what the Church is, from the Church her ſelf; which is like giving marks whereby to know an Unicorn, before I know whether there be an Unicorn or not, or what it is.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another blunder in this Diſpute about Notes is, That they give us Notes whereby to find out the true Catholick Church, before we know what a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church is. For all <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Notes are intended only for the Catholick Church; and therefore his firſt Note is the <hi>name Catholick;</hi> whereas the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church is nothing elſe but all true Chriſtian Churches in the World, united together by one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Faith and Worſhip, and ſuch acts of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion as diſtinct Churches are capable of, and obliged to. Every particular Church which profeſſes the true Faith and Worſhip of Chriſt, is a true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church; and the Catholick Church is all the true Chriſtian Churches in the World; which have all the ſame Nature, and are in ſome ſenſe of the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: So that it is impoſſible to know what the Catholick Church is, before we know what a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church is, as it is to know what the Sea is, before we know what Water is: Every true, ſingle, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church has the whole and intire nature of a Church, and would be a true Church, though there were no other Church in the World; as the Chriſtian Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was, before any other Chriſtian Churches were planted; and therefore there can be no other Notes of a True Church, but what belong
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:104627:27"/>to every true particular Church; and that can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is eſſential to a Church, and what all true Chriſtian Churches in the World agree in, <hi>viz.</hi> The True Faith and Worſhip of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Now, ſo far as <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Notes belong to every true particular Church, ſo far we allow them, and let the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> make the beſt of them She can; for we doubt not to make our claim to them, as good, and much better than hers; but he has named very few ſuch; the 6th, the Agreement and Conſent in Doctrine with the Ancient and Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church; and the 8th the Holineſs of its Doctrine, are the cheif, if not the only Notes of this nature; and theſe we will ſtand and fall by; many of his other, are not properly the Notes of a true Church, any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than as they are Teſtimonies of the truth of common Chriſtianity, which is profeſſed by all true Churches; and if they are Notes of the Church, ſo every true particular Church has a ſhare in them. Such as his 9th, the efficacy of Doctrine. The 10th, the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the lives of the firſt Authors and Fathers of our Religion; and I ſuppoſe, the Holineſs of Chriſt and his Apoſtles give Teſtimony to the truth of common Chriſtianity, and therefore to all Churches who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the common Faith once delivered to the Saints. The 11th, the Glory of Miracles, which alſo proves the truth of Chriſtian Religion; and I hope a little better than Popiſh Miracles do Tranſubſtantiation. The 12th, is the Spirit of Propheſy, which as far as it is a good Note, belongs to the Religion, not to the Church. Other Notes he aſſigns, which I doubt will prove no Notes at all, as 13, 14, 15. becauſe they are not always true, and at beſt uncertain.</p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:104627:27"/>
                  <p>His third and fourth Notes are not Notes of a Church, but God's Promiſes made to his Church: as of a long Duration, that it ſhall never fail, and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude or Extent, and multitude of Believers. Theſe Promiſes we believe God will fulfil to his Church, but they can be no Notes, which is the true Church. For the firſt of theſe can never be a Note till the day of Judgment. That Church which ſhall never be deſtroyed is the true Church, but a bare long continuance is no Mark of a true Church; for an Apoſtatical Church may continue by the patience and forbearance of God many hundred Years, and be deſtroyed at laſt; and then this Argument of a long Duration is confuted: And as for Amplitude and Extent, that is not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh one Chriſtian Church from another, that the moſt numerous Church ſhould be the trueſt, but to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the Chriſtian Church from all other Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and then I doubt this Prophecy has not received its juſt Accompliſhment yet; for tho we take in all the Chriſtian Churches in the World, and not exclude the greateſt part of them, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does, yet they bear but a ſmall proportion to the reſt of the World.</p>
                  <p>And now there are but three of his fifteen Notes of the Church left. The firſt concerning the Name <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,</hi> which makes every Church a Catholick Church, which will call it ſelf ſo: Tho Catholick does not declare what a Church is, but in what Communion it is, and is no Note of a true Church, unleſs it be firſt proved, that they are true Churches, which are in Communion with each other: For if three parts in four of all the Churches in the World were very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and degenerate in Faith and Worſhip, and were in one Communion, this would be the moſt Catholick
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:104627:28"/>Communion, as Catholick ſignifies the moſt general and univerſal; but yet the fourth part, which is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, would be the beſt and trueſt Church, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, as that ſignifies the Communion of all Orthodox and Pure Churches.</p>
                  <p>His firſt Note is, <hi>the Succeſſion of Biſhops in the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>from the Apoſtles till now.</hi> This is a Note of the Roman Church; and the Succeſſion of Biſhops in the Greek Church, is as good a Note of the Greek Church. And any Churches which have been later planted, who have Biſhops in Succeſſion from any of the Apoſtles or Apoſtolical Biſhops, by this Note are as good Churches as they. So that this is a Note com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all true Churches, and therefore can do the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> no Service.</p>
                  <p>His ſeventh Note indeed is home to his purpoſe: That that is the only true Church, which is united to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as to its Head. If he could prove this, it muſt do his buſineſs without any other Notes, but that will be examined hereafter. But it is like the Confidence of a Jeſuit, to make that the Note of the Church, which is the chief Subject of the Diſpute.</p>
                  <p>The Sum is this: There can be no Notes of a true Church, but what belong to all true Churches: for tho there is but one Catholick Church, yet there are a great many true particular Churches, which make up this Catholick Church, as homogeneal Parts, which have all the ſame Nature. But now very few of the Cardinal's Notes belong to all true Churches; and thoſe which do ſo, ſignifie nothing to his purpoſe, becauſe they are common to more Churches than the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And as for the Catholick Church, that is known only by particular Churches; for it is nothing elſe, but the Union of all true Churches in Faith and Worſhip,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:104627:28"/>and one Communion, as far as diſtinct Churches at a great diſtance from each other are capable of it: And therefore there is no other way to know which is the Catholick Church, but by knowing all the true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the World, which either are in actual Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with one another, or are in a Diſpoſition for it, whenever occaſion is offered: For it is impoſſible that all true Chriſtian Churches all the World over, ſhould ever joyn in any viſible and external Acts of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: and therefore tho we know and believe, that there is a Catholick Church, becauſe we are aſſured that all true Churches in the World are but one Church, the one Body and Spouſe of Chriſt; yet it is next to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to know all the Parts of the Catholick Church (without which we cannot know the whole Catholick Church) becauſe we cannot know all the particular true Churches all the World over. Nor indeed is there any need we ſhould: For we may certainly know which is a truly Catholick Church, without knowing the whole Catholick Church. For every Church, which profeſſes the true Catholick Faith, and impoſes only Catholick Terms of Communion, and is ready, out of the Principles of Brotherly Love and Charity (that cement of Catholick Communion) to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with all Churches, and to receive all Churches to her Communion upon theſe Terms, is a truly Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, which ſhews how ridiculous it is to make the Catholick Church our firſt Inquiry, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to give Notes to find out the true Catholick Church by, before we know what a true Particular Church is. But the Myſtery of this will appear more in what follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3dly.</hi> For another Myſtery of finding the true Church by Notes, is to pick out of all the Chriſtian
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:104627:29"/>Churches in the World one Church, which we muſt own for the only Catholick Church; and reject all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches as Heretical, or Schiſmatical, or Un-ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Churches, who refuſe Obedience and Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to this One Catholick Church. For if this be not the Intent of it, what will all the Notes of the Church ſignify to prove, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the only true Catholick Church? And if they do not prove this, the Cardinal has loſt his labour. For tho the Notes he aſſigns were the Notes of a true Church, yet they may and muſt belong to all other true Churches, as well as to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> unleſs he can prove, that there is but One true Church, or but One Church, which is the Miſtreſs of all other Churches, and the only Principle and Center of Catholick Unity. And this ought to have been proved firſt, before he had thought of the Notes of the Church.</p>
                  <p>So that there are many things to be proved here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are ready for the Notes of the Church? They muſt firſt prove, that there is but one true Church in the World: for tho we all grant, that there is but One Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, yet we ſay, there may be, and hope, nay more than ſo, know that there are many true Churches, which make up the Catholick Church. Yet before the Notes of a true Church can do any Service to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they muſt prove, that there is but one true Church in the World; and then it will ſignify ſomething to prove the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be that true Church.</p>
                  <p>They muſt prove alſo, that the Catholick Church does not ſignify all the particular true Churches that are in the World; but ſome one Church, which is the Fountain of Catholick Unity; which all other Churches are bound to ſubmit to, and communicate with, if they
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:104627:29"/>will be Members of the Catholick Church. For tho all the Churches in the World were in Subjection to that Church, yet they receive their Catholiciſm from their Communion with that Church; and therefore that only is the Catholick Church. It is not meerly the Communion of all Churches together, which makes the Catholick Church; but it is the Subjection of all Churches to that one Catholick Church, which makes them Catholick: So that they muſt prove, that there is one particular Church, which is the Catholick Church; that is, that a part is the whole; that one particular Church is all the Churches of the World; for ſo the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church ſignifies in Ancient Writers. This is ſo abſurd, that ſome of our Modern Advocates for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church of <hi>Rome</hi> tell us, that they do not mean the particular Dioceſs of <hi>Rome</hi> by the Catholick Church, but all thoſe Churches, which are in Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> But ſuppoſe this, yet it is only the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> which makes all the other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Catholick, and therefore ſhe only is the Catholick Church. And I will preſently make them confeſs it to be ſo: For let us ſuppoſe, that no other Churches ſhould ſubmit themſelves to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> underſtanding the particular Dioceſs of <hi>Rome</hi>) would ſhe be the Catholick Church or not? If notwithſtanding this ſhe would be the Catholick Church; then it is evident, that they make the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the Catholick Church; if ſhe would not, then I cannot ſee how Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is eſſential to the Catholick Church.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things, I ſay, ought to have been proved, before the Cardinal had given us the Notes of the Church; for it is a hard thing to prove by Notes, that the particular Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the only Catholick Church, till it be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104627:30"/>proved, that a particular Church may be the Catholick Church, or that there is one particular Church, which is the Catholick Church. This he knew we all deny; and it is a ridiculous thing to think to convince us by Notes, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the particular Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church; when we deny that there is any ſuch Church; and affirm, that it is a Contradiction to own it; as great a Contradiction, as it is to ſay, that a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church is the Univerſal Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>4thly.</hi> But when I conſider the farther Deſign of theſe Note-Makers, to find out ſuch a Church on whoſe Authority we muſt rely for the whole Chriſtian Faith, even for the holy Scriptures themſelves, it makes me now admire, that they ſhould think this could be done by ſome Notes of a Church; eſpecially by ſuch Notes as the Cardinal gives us.</p>
                  <p>For ſuppoſe he had given us the Notes of a true <hi>Church,</hi> which is the utmoſt he can pretend to; before we can hence conclude that this Church is the Infallible Guide, and uncontroulable Judg of Controverſies, we muſt be ſatisfied, that the true Church is Infallible. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> attempts to prove in his third Book of the Church; and it is not my Concern at preſent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how he proves it. But I am ſure this can never be proved but by Scripture; for unleſs Chriſt have beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Infallibility on the Church, I know not how we can prove ſhe has it; and whether Chriſt have done it or not, can never be known but by the Scriptures: So that a Man muſt believe the Scriptures, and uſe his own Judgment to underſtand them, before it can be proved to him, that there is an Infallible Church; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe who reſolve the belief of the Scriptures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Authority of the Church, cannot, without great Impudence, urge the Authority of the Scriptures to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:104627:30"/>prove the Church's Infallibility; and yet thus they all do; nay prove their very Notes of the Church from Scripture, as the Cardinal does: and think this is no Circle neither, becauſe we Hereticks believe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures without the Authority of their Church, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are willing to diſpute with them out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. But this is a fault on our ſide, and when we diſpute with them, whatever we do at other times, we ſhould not believe the Scriptures, till they had proved them to us their way, by the Authority or their Church; and then we ſhould quickly ſee what bleſſed Work they would make of it. How they would prove their Church's Infallibility, and what fine Notes we ſhould have of a Church, when we had rejected all their Scripture-proofs, as we ought to do, till they have firſt ſatisfied us, that theirs is the only true Infallible Church, upon whoſe Authority we muſt believe the Scriptures, and every thing elſe. I confeſs, I would gladly hear what Notes they would give a Pagan to find out the true Infallible Church by.</p>
                  <p>It is certainly a moſt ſenſleſs thing to reſolve all our Faith into the Authority of the Church, as if the Church were the firſt Object or our Faith in Religion; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is demonſtrable, that we muſt know and believe moſt of the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith before we can know whether there be any Church or not. The order obſerved in the Apoſtles Creed is a plain Evidence of this, for all thoſe Articles which are before the Holy Catholick Church muſt in order of Nature be known before it. That there is a God who made the World; that Jeſus Chriſt is the only begotten Son of God, who was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> ſuffered under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> was crucified, dead, and buried, and deſcended into Hell, that he
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:104627:31"/>roſe again the third day from the dead, and aſcended into Heaven, and ſitteth on the Right-hand of God the Father Almighty, and from thence ſhall come to judg the Quick and the Dead; I believe in the Holy Ghoſt; and then we may add the Holy Catholick Church, and not till then. For the Church is a Society of Men for the Worſhip of God, through the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, by the Sanctification of the Holy Spirit, which unites them into one Myſtical Body: So that we muſt know Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, before we can know what the Catholick Church means. And is it not ſtrange then, that our Faith muſt be founded on the Authority of the Church, when we muſt firſt know all the great Articles of our Faith, before we can know any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Church. This inverts the order of our Creed, which according to the Principles of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould begin thus. I believe in the Holy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, and upon the Authority of that Church, I believe in God the Father Almighty, and in Jeſus Chriſt, and in the Holy Ghoſt: and no doubt but the Apoſtles, or thoſe Apoſtolical Men, who framed the Creed, would have put it ſo, had they thought the whole Chriſtian Faith muſt be reſolved into the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church.</p>
                  <p>This ſhort Diſcourſe, I think, is enough in general concerning the Notes of the Church; and I ſhall leave the particular Examination of Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Notes to other Hands, which the Reader may expect to follow in their order.</p>

                     <p>THat the ſincere Preaching of the Faith or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt, as it's laid down in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is the only, ſure, Infallible Mark of the Church of Chriſt, is a Truth ſo clear in it ſelf, ſo often and fully prov'd by Learned Men of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that it may juſtly ſeem a Wonder, that any Church, which is not conſcious to her ſelf of any Errors and Deviations from it, ſhould refuſe to put her ſelf upon that Tryal: This gave Being to the Church of Chriſt at firſt, makes it One and makes it Catholick. According as this fares in any Part or Member of it, is that Church diſtinguiſh'd and denominated; it will be True or Falſe, Pure or Corrupt, Sound or Heretical, according as the Faith it holds bears a conformity or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance to the written Doctrine of our Saviour: An
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104627:32"/>Orthodox Faith makes an Orthodox Church, but if her Faith becomes Tainted and Heterodox, the Church will be ſo too; and ſhould it happen wholly to Apoſtatize from the Faith of Chriſt, it would wholly ceaſe to be a Chriſtian Church. This may ſeem to be the Reaſon, that the preſent Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> being notoriouſly warp'd from Truth, declines the being examined and meaſur'd by this Rule, (having indeed ſome reaſon to be againſt the Scripture that is ſo evidently againſt her) and endeavours to ſupport her ſelf with great Names and Swelling Titles: Hence it is that we ſo often hear of the <hi>Name of Catholick, Antiquity, Amplitude, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, Succeſſion, Miracles, Prophecy,</hi> and ſeveral others that their great Cardinal ſets down, as ſo many perpetual and never-failing Marks and Characters to find out the True Church, and to Aſſert his own.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall in this ſhort Tract examine the firſt of theſe, and that I may give it all the fair play imaginable, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to repreſent it in its full force and to its beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; <hi>Bellarmin</hi> makes it thus to ſpeak for it ſelf: <hi>The Apoſtle in</hi> 1 Cor. 3.4. <hi>makes it the Sign and Mark of Sciſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks to be called after the Name of particular Men, tho' of the Apoſtles themſelves, whether of</hi> Paul <hi>or</hi> Apollos <hi>or</hi> Cephas: <hi>And in the Writings of the ancient Fathers, the Orthodox Churches were known and diſtinguiſh'd by the name of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and the Conventicles of Sciſmaticks and Hereticks, by the Names of their firſt Authors: And therefore ſince the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is by all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even her bittereſt Adverſaries, called</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, <hi>and the ſeveral Sects of the Reform'd, after the Names of their particular Doctors, as</hi> Luther, Calvin, Zuinglius, <hi>and the like; it follows that the Name of</hi> Catholick <hi>is not only a ſure undoubted Mark of the true Church, but alſo that this Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is that Church:</hi> This is his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and as much as he values his Church upon it, I
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:104627:32"/>can ſee no more in it but this, that becauſe Churches profeſſing the true <hi>Orthodox Faith,</hi> were anciently ſtyl'd Catholick, therefore all that have been ſtyled Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſince, <hi>be their Faith what it will,</hi> muſt be True and Orthodox Churches: And becauſe the Apoſtle forbids Chriſtians to be call'd after the Name of particular Men, tho of never ſo great Eminency in the Church: And thoſe mentioned in the Works of the Ancients were really Sciſmaticks and Hereticks, <hi>that were ſo call'd,</hi> as the <hi>Valentinians, Marcionites, Montaniſts,</hi> and others: Therefore all that in after-Ages ſhall be ſo nick-nam'd, tho out of Malice and Ill-will by their Enemies, whilſt they diſown it themſelves, muſt go for Sciſmaticks and Hereticks. This is ſo weak a Topick, that I might juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly break off here, having expos'd it ſufficiently by a bare Repreſenting of it: Yet for the Reader's farther Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and Satisfaction in this matter, I ſhall proceed to ſhew theſe three Things.

                     <p>And this, as evidently appears from their Writings, and even from thoſe Teſtimonies cited by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:104627:33"/>was upon the Account of the Catholick Faith; that in their Time was generally and for the moſt part in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the Name of Catholick; and when ever it is ſo, 'twill be an Infallible Note of a Catholick Church. The Catholick Faith is that which was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd by Chriſt himſelf to his Apoſtles, and by them to the Church, contain'd in thoſe Writings, which they by the extraordinary Direction and Aſſiſtance of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt indited, and commended to the Care and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all the Churches planted by them, as a ſure uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Rule of Faith and Manners; <hi>Call'd Catholick,</hi> both as it contains all things in it neceſſary to Salvation, and as it was to be preach'd and publiſh'd in all times, and ſucceſſively in all places: According to <hi>Vincent. Lirin.</hi> Rule, <hi>quod ſemper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibus creditum eſt:</hi> It ſet out at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but was not to ſtop there, but from thence to ſpread it ſelf into all parts of the World. The Apoſtles were firſt to preach to the loſt Sheep of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but not to them only; <hi>Go, teach all Nations,</hi> was our Saviour's Commiſſion to the Apoſtles; and, <hi>I will give thee the Heathen for thine Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,</hi> and <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was God's promiſe to our Saviour. The Chriſtian Church was not to be confin'd within the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of one Nation, like that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> within the ſmall Territories of <hi>Judaea,</hi> but to be made up of <hi>every Kindred, and Tongue, and People, and Nation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, before the main Body of the Church was divided, only ſome few miſled and ſeduc'd People ſeparating from it, it being general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, that they <hi>that bore the Name of Catholick,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the <hi>true Catholick Faith,</hi> and thoſe that were called after the name of particular Men, had deprav'd and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted it, the very name Catholick became a diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing Note of a true Church, and to be call'd after
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:104627:33"/>the Name of the Author of any Sect, the Mark of an Heretical and Sciſmatical one; but yet this was not ſo much for the Sake of the bare Names, as for the things, the Tenets and Doctrines ſignified by them. In this Senſe are all thoſe Fathers to be underſtood, quoted by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others, who ſeem to lay any ſtreſs upon the Name: 'Twas upon the Account of the true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith, that in thoſe times did for the moſt part, if not every where, accompany and go along with the Name: Thus when St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> advis'd his Catechumens, when they ſhould go into any City,<note place="margin">Cap. 18. Catech.</note> to enquire for the Catholick Church, he gave this Reaſon for it, <hi>becauſe there the true Catholick Faith is taught,</hi> and in the ſame place adds, <hi>The Church is therefore call'd Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,</hi> becauſe <hi>it teaches all thoſe Truths all Men are bound to know in order to Salvation;</hi> and upon the ſame Account, <hi>Pacianus</hi> not unfitly ſaid, <hi>Chriſtian is my Name, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick my Sirname;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Sym. pron. de nom. Cath.</note> 
                        <hi>by the one I am diſtinguiſhed from Heathens, by the other from Hereticks and Sciſmaticks:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in that Age few or none went by the Name of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, but thoſe that were ſo indeed, and profeſt the true Catholick Faith. And as this is a true Account of the Original of <hi>the Name Catholick,</hi> and the weight that was laid upon it in thoſe early Times, ſo will the Name ever continue to be a ſure unerring Note of the Catholick Church, whilſt it is inſeparably conjoyn'd with the Profeſſion of the Catholick Faith: Where this is taught and profeſt, there's a true Church; where this fails in part or in whole, the Church decays, or is loſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. <hi>No Argument can be drawn from the bare Name of Catholick to prove a Church to be Catholick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is ſo clear and evident in it ſelf, that it neither needs nor is ſcarce capable of a proof; <hi>The Church of</hi>
                        <pb n="30" facs="tcp:104627:34"/>Rome <hi>is call'd Catholick, therefore ſhe is Catholick; The Papiſts are call'd Catholicks, therefore they are Catholicks:</hi> This is ſuch a way of Reaſoning, that every Man muſt be aſham'd to own, but thoſe who have the confidence to ſay any thing, when they are not able to ſay any thing to the Purpoſe. For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Chriſtian Church was not known by the Name of Catholick at the beginning, and therefore it can be no Eſſential Note of it. We find no mention of this Name in the Writings of the New Teſtament: We read, That <hi>the Diſciples were called Chriſtians at Antioch;</hi> but the name Catholick, principally reſpecting the diffuſive Nature of the Church, the Church could not properly be ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, till the Chriſtian Faith had been more generally and univerſally preach'd in the World: Therefore <hi>Pacianus</hi> in the fore-quoted Place confeſſes, that the Name Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick was not us'd in the Church in the Days of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; and from thence ſome have concluded, that the Creed which goes under the Apoſtles Name, having this Denomination of the Church inſerted in it, <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> was not compos'd by them, but by ſome Holy Biſhops of a later ſtanding in the Church; yet muſt it be confeſs'd that the Name is very ancient and of an early Date, it being found in the Oriental Creeds, particularly thoſe of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and in the Inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of St. <hi>James,</hi> St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>John,</hi> and St. <hi>Jude</hi>'s Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, which are all ſtyl'd General or <hi>Catholick</hi> Epiſtles.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Names are oftentimes arbitrarily and at random, and falſly impos'd on Things, and therefore nothing can be concluded from them: The Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> had a Name to live, but was dead; the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> gloried that ſhe was rich, but was poor; many on Earth are call'd Gods, who are but mortal Men; <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was call'd the great Power of God, but was a Child of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:104627:34"/>the Devil; <hi>Mahomet</hi> a great Prophet, but was an <hi>Impoſtor; Diana</hi> the great <hi>Goddeſs</hi> of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> but was an <hi>Idol;</hi> our Bleſſed Saviour foretold that many ſhould come in his Name, each ſaying, I am <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but were <hi>Deceivers.</hi> Thus, you ſee, Things and Perſons are not always as they are call'd; nor do I believe the Papiſts are willing that their Church ſhould be thought in reality to be, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſignification of ſome Names that are too liberally beſtow'd upon her; the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> calls himſelf <hi>Chriſt's Vicar,</hi> but others, <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſtyles her ſelf the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> but others, the <hi>Whore of Babylon.</hi> I do as little juſtify the faſtening ſuch odious Names upon them, as approve their arroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to themſelves the other glorious Titles; yet this I am pretty well aſſur'd of, that a Man of ordinary Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may ſay as much to prove the <hi>Pope, Antichriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> an <hi>Harlot;</hi> as the whole Colledg can to juſtify the pretence of the one to be <hi>Chriſt's Vicar,</hi> or of the other, to be his <hi>undefiled Spouſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Names are oftentimes impos'd on things, and ſo us'd, as Marks of diſtinction only without any farther deſign of repreſenting their Natures and Qualities by them; thus we call the Romaniſts <hi>Catholicks,</hi> not that we think they are truly ſo, but in Complement, or Irony, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance with common uſe, or by way of Diſcrimination from other Chriſtians; and in the ſame reſpects, it may be ſuppos'd, that they call us the <hi>Reform'd:</hi> And if they think this is a good Argument to prove them <hi>Catholicks,</hi> we have the ſame, and 'twill hold as ſtrong, to prove us <hi>Reform'd.</hi> They call us the <hi>Reformed,</hi> therefore we are <hi>Reformed,</hi> is as good an Argument as, we call them <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,</hi> therefore they are <hi>Catholicks:</hi> In this Senſe are thoſe Words of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> cited by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Contr. Epiſt. Fundam. c. 4.</note> to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; <hi>That ſhould a Stranger happen in any City to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:104627:35"/>enquire even of an Heretick, where he might go to a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church; the Heretick would not dare to ſend him to his own Houſe or Oratory.</hi> Not that that Heretick did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that thoſe that there were call'd Catholicks, did hold the true Catholick Doctrine, for then he could not have believ'd his own; but looking upon it as a bare name of Diſtinction, he directed him to that Aſſembly of Chriſtians, that were ſo called. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſeems here to ſuppoſe a Caſe, as if a Traveller entring into a City, where both Popiſh and Reform'd Churches were allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſhould chance to meet a Proteſtant, and of him enquire the way to a Catholick Church, and he direct him to a Popiſh one; or a Papiſt, and of him enquire the way to a Reform'd Church, and he direct him to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant one: It would not therefore follow, that either the one or the other did believe either Church to anſwer and correſpond with its Name, that the Popiſh was Catholick or the Proteſtant Reformed; but that they were Words of vulgar uſe, whereby they might be known from one another, but not the true Church from the falſe.</p>
                     <p n="4">IIII. It does not follow, that becauſe the Name of Catholick in that time, when it was for the moſt part in conjunction with the Catholick Faith, was a ſure Note of a true Church, it muſt always be ſo, even when the Name and Thing are parted. It was not long before the Chriſtian Church became miſerably torn and rent aſunder, divided into many and ſome very great Bodies, all pretending to <hi>Catholiciſm.</hi> By what Mark now is the Catholick Church to be known? Not by the Name ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when all Parties laid claim to it, and the groſſeſt Hereticks, ſuch as the <hi>Manichaeans</hi> themſelves, as St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> tells us, who had the leaſt to ſhew for it, coveted and gloried in it. Have never any Hereticks or Sciſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:104627:35"/>been ſtyled Catholicks? Nor ever any Orthodox ſtyl'd Hereticks? The Greek Church is call'd Catholick, and yet the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will have her an <hi>Heretical one:</hi> The <hi>Donatiſts</hi> appropriated to themſelves that am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Title; and yet St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> thought them no better than Shciſmaticks: The <hi>Arrians</hi> call'd themſelves <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and the <hi>Orthodox, Homouſians</hi> and <hi>Athanaſians;</hi> but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one was the more, nor the other the leſs Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick for what they were call'd. Truth is always the ſame, and the Nature of things remains unalterable, let Men fix on them what Names they pleaſe: By this Rule then is the true Church to be known, not becauſe it bears the Name of <hi>Catholick,</hi> for that a Church may do, and yet be guilty of <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Hereſie,</hi> but becauſe it profeſſes the true Faith, and then tho it be in name <hi>Heretick,</hi> it is in reality <hi>Catholick;</hi> This is <hi>Lactantius</hi>'s Rule, to diſcern the true Church by the true Religion; <hi>That Church alone,</hi>

                     <p n="5">5. Again, does it follow, that becauſe, the being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led after the Names of particular Men, in that Age, when all ſo call'd, were for the moſt part corrupt in the Faith, was a ſure Brand of Schiſmaticks and Hereticks, it muſt ever be ſo?

If the Churches of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed muſt go for Hereticks and Sciſmaticks, meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are diſtinguiſh'd by the Names of thoſe Men that were the firſt and moſt eminent Inſtruments in that bleſſed Work, as of <hi>Lutherans, Calviniſts, Zuinglians,</hi> &amp; the like; Is there not the ſame Reaſon that the ſeveral Orders

If there be any Difference, the advantage of Reaſon is on our Side; ſince the Reformed aſſume not thoſe Names to themſelves, and tho they deſervedly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Memories of thoſe Men, and with thankful Hearts embrace the Reformation God was pleas'd by their Miniſtry to make in the Church, yet do they by no means affect to be call'd after their Names: They own no Name but <hi>Chriſtian</hi> or <hi>Catholick,</hi> when it ſignifies Perſons adhering to the true <hi>Catholick Faith:</hi> The others are Nick-names faſten'd on them by their Adverſaries out of Scorn or Malice, to repreſent them to the World, (as far as they are able) as ſo many <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> from the Catholick Church, and as having other Leaders than Chriſt and his Apoſtles: But thoſe in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that are denominated from their particular Founders, give themſelves thoſe Appellations, ſeem to prefer them before that truly Catholick one of Chriſtian, which while with ſome neglect they leave to the Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they glory and pride themſelves in the other; ſo that if this Note of an Heretick is valid, it turns with great Force againſt themſelves, who are really guilty of it, and not againſt us, whom they will make guilty of it, but are not.</p>

                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe that which is proper to a Thing is inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from it, and did ever belong to it ſince it had a Being; and can at no Time, without the deſtruction of its Being, be abſent from it. This every Freſh-Man in Learning knows; and by that may know, that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity is not a Note proper to the Church, becauſe it did not always belong to the Church: For there was a Time when the Church was New. Which was object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it by the Adverſaries of our Religion: and the Defenders of the Church anſwered the very ſame to them then, that we do to the Romaniſts now; as will appear in the ſecond Thing I have to obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That other Societies have laid claim to this Note, and it could not be denied them; and therefore 'tis not a proper Note, whereby the true Church may be certainly known: being common to it, with others that are not of the Church.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For, firſt, the <hi>Samaritans</hi> claimed it againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> as appears from the Womans Diſcourſe with our Saviour, Joh. iv. 20. <hi>Our Fathers worſhipped in this Mountain, &amp;c.</hi> They had done ſo, for many Ages before they worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> For here God appeared unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> who here alſo built an Altar when he came firſt out of <hi>Chaldea,</hi> Gen. xii. 6, 7.

                     </p>
                     <p>Let this be applied to our preſent Buſineſs, and it is ſufficient to ſhew, that <hi>bare Antiquity</hi> cannot be a Note of Truth: For there are very ancient Errors.

                        <hi>Without doubt the True Church is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienter than the Falſe; as God was before the Devil: And conſequently we reade the good Seed was ſown firſt before the Tares.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But who doth not ſee, that theſe two things are wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different, the one from the other; <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and <hi>Priority;</hi> that which is <hi>Ancient,</hi> and that which is <hi>Firſt?</hi> Whatſoever is <hi>First,</hi> is undoubtedly true; but whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is <hi>Ancient,</hi> is not always ſo; unleſs it be of ſuch Antiquity, that it be alſo <hi>First.</hi> There is a double Antiquity therefore; one in reſpect of us; the other abſolute and in it ſelf. This laſt ſort of Antiquity is the ſame, with what is <hi>First:</hi> Unto which we are deſirous to go, to which we are willing to ſtand, and by which we would be judged. By the Rule, which <hi>Tertullian</hi> lays down in ſeveral of his Books,<note n="*" place="margin">L. iv. contra <hi>Marcion.</hi> c. 5. Adv. <hi>Praxeam.</hi> c. 2.

                        <note n="†" place="margin">Apologia c. xlvii.</note>, <hi>built before upon the Divine Learning. This is the Rule of Faith, which came from Chriſt, tranſmitted to us by his Companions; to whom all thoſe who ſpeak other ways, will be found to be of later date.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to this they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will by no means agree; they do not like to be tryed only by the Holy Scriptures, which is the true Antiquity; that is,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:104627:43"/>undoubtedly <hi>Firſt,</hi> before all other Traditions.

                     <p>Mere Antiquity therefore, is not a good Proof. For though the Devil be not <hi>firſt,</hi> yet he is of great <hi>Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> being <hi>the old</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

And if there had not been ſomething elſe, whereby he might have been diſcovered to be a Serpent; who could have contradicted him? Or confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Doctrine and Worſhip, if they had been to be tried by bare Antiquity? Which is a Proof ſo inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that God Himſelf, as ye heard before out of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin, is not proved to be God by Antiquity, but by Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Truth and Error were born ſo near together, that after a long Tract of Time, they could not be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed merely by their Age. No ſooner was Man cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, but this Serpent, by his Subtilty, beguiled <hi>Eve.</hi> And immediately after our Redemption, he attempted again <hi>to corrupt Mens Minds from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. xi. 3. 1 Theſſ. iii. 5. And accordingly, as there was a <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> ſo there was, together therewith, a <hi>Synagogue of Satan,</hi> Rev. iii. 9. There were <hi>Depths of Satan</hi> alſo, and a Myſtery of Iniquity (which wrought even in the Apoſtles Days) as well as
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:104627:43"/>
                        <hi>a Myſtery of Godlineſs,</hi> and the <hi>deep things of God.</hi> Which wicked Doctrines running down to Poſterity, made uſe, at length, of the Plea of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> to give them Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and Support. Nor could it be denied, tho it was proved to be a mere Deceit. For it was refuted by the Fathers in ſuch remarkable Words as theſe (which give a deadly blow to the like Plea of the preſent Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church) <hi>Cuſtom without Truth, is but the Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Error. And there is a ſhort way for Religious and Simple Minds to find out what is Truth: For if we return to the Beginning and Original of Divine Tradition, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Error ceaſes.

                        <hi>If therefore Christ alone is to be heard, we ought not to regard, what another before us thought fit to be done, but what Christ, who is before all, firſt did. For we ought not to follow the Cuſtom of Man, but the Truth of God; ſince God himſelf ſpeaks thus by the Prophet</hi> Iſaiah, <hi>In vain do they worſhip me, teaching the Commandments and Doctrines of Men.

                     </p>
                     <p>Which leads me to the <hi>ſecond</hi> thing I undertook to ſhew; that the preſent Church of <hi>Rome</hi> vainly pretends to true Antiquity, <hi>i.e.</hi> to <hi>ancient Truth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">II. The Antiquity of a Church doth not conſiſt in the Antiquity of the <hi>Place,</hi> where it is ſeated: For a <hi>new Worſhip</hi> may come into an <hi>ancient Place</hi> of Worſhip; as the new Altar of <hi>Ahaz</hi> was introduced into the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where he ſacrificed to the Gods of <hi>Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> xvi. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxviii. 23; Nor doth it conſiſt meerly in the Antiquity of its <hi>Founders:</hi> For the Apoſtles founded many Churches, which had all the ſame Title to Antiquity in this regard; and yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued not ſuch Churches as they left them, but decayed (ſome of them) ſo faſt, that what Truth and Goodneſs remained among them, was ready to dye, even before all the Apoſtles were dead, <hi>Rev.</hi> iii. 2. But it's true, Antiquity conſiſts in the Preſervation of the ancient Truth, entire and uncorrupted; which it received from the Apoſtles, and which made it, at firſt, to be a Church.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe things are truly ancient, which perſiſt in the ſame State, after a long Tract of Time, wherein they were at their beginning. For if they have ſuffered any Change in that which belongs to their Being and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:104627:44"/>they have loſt their Antiquity, and become another thing, than they were at the firſt. Now to know this, we muſt enquire into the Nature of the thing it ſelf, and underſtand (for inſtance) what it is, that makes a Society to be the Church of God. And all agree it is the Chriſtian Truth: In which, if it have ſuffered Alteration (that is, doth not hold the ſame Chriſtian Doctrine it did at the beginning, but hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced Errors and Lies under the pretence of ancient Truth) it is not the ſame Church it was at firſt; and therefore hath not that Mark of true Antiquity, which will prove it to be ſuch as it pretends.</p>
                     <p>Now that this is the Caſe of the preſent Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is evident by that Alteration they have made in the <hi>ancient Creed:</hi> Unto which they have added as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more Articles as there were at the firſt, and thereby made ſuch a Change in their Church (for a Change is made by adding, as well as taking away) as makes it not to be the ſame ancient Church, which the Apoſtles founded at the beginning.</p>
                     <p>This Charge they have no way to avoid, nor can by any other means maintain, that they are ſuch an ancient Church, as Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſetled, but by this <hi>Ratiocination,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> calls it. That in all great Changes of Religion, theſe <hi>ſix</hi> things may be ever ſhewn; 1. The Author of that Change. 2. The new Doctrine that was brought in. 3. The Time when it began. 4. The Place where. 5. Who oppoſed it. 6. And who joyned themſelves to it. None of which can be ſhewn in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſince the Apoſtles times; and therefore there hath been no Change at all made in it, but it remains the ſame it was at firſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Alteration.</p>
                     <p>Which is a reaſoning built upon grounds ſo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly falſe, that it ſcarce deſerves the Name of a poor Piece of Sophiſtry.</p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:104627:45"/>
                     <p n="1">1. For firſt, it is contrary to all Hiſtory and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; which ſhews us there have been great Changes, the Authors, and the Beginnings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which cannot now be known: Though no Man can doubt there hath been an Alteration made. For the Body Spiritual and Civil too, is like the Body Natural: In which as there are ſome Diſeaſes which make ſuch a violent and ſudden Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, that one may ſay, at what moment they began: So there are other, which grow ſo inſenſibly and by ſuch ſlow Degrees, that none can tell when the firſt Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was made, and by what Accident, from a good Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Body to a bad. Thus we are ſure a Man is in a deep Conſumption, when we ſee him worn away to Skin and Bone, though no body can tell the preciſe time when, nor by what means, nor where and in what Company his Blood began to be tainted. And thus we are ſure there is a <hi>Gangrene</hi> (as St <hi>Paul</hi> calls Hereſy) when we ſee it corrode the Body of the Church; though it crept in ſo ſecretly at the firſt, and ſo indiſcernably, that it was not ſuſpected, nor can alway be traced to its firſt Occaſion and Original. No, the <hi>Tares in the Field</hi> (which is another Example whereby our Lord himſelf illuſtrates this matter) had taken root before they were eſpied; for they were ſown in the Night, while Men ſlept (and could take no notice of it) ſo that all that could be known, was this, that his Enemy had done it: That is, the Tares were not from our Saviour, nor were <hi>firſt</hi> ſown; but were of a later and quite different Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: But by what particular Inſtrument the Enemy ſowed them; at what hour of the Night, by what hand and when, did not appear; for the matter was carried ſo ſecretly and in the dark, that the Servants, who knew of the ſowing of the good Seed in the Field, wondred to ſee the bad, and ask'd <hi>Whence hath it Tares?</hi> They did not know, that is, how they came there, no more than
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:104627:45"/>we may be able now to know, how Errors came into the Church: But that they were there they knew and were ſure; as we are ſure there are falſe Doctrines in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that were not of our Saviour's planting.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Nor do the Examples whereby they illuſtrate this Ratiocination ſerve to any purpoſe, but to ſhew the Falſeneſs of it. They can name, they ſay, the Authors and Beginnings of all the ancient Hereſies; for inſtance, the Hereſy which affirmed there were two Perſons in Chriſt, was begun by <hi>Neſtorius</hi> in the Year CDXXXI. Which is not true; for though then it took its Name from ſo great a Biſhop, who maintained it; yet the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy had been before, from an unknown Beginning; it being mentioned by St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> in the foregoing Age, in his Book of the <hi>Incarnation.</hi> The like may be ſaid of the <hi>Arian</hi> Hereſy; whoſe Beginning they date in the Year CCCXXIV. but it was born long before among the Gnoſtick Hereticks; and only got Reputation by ſo noted a Man as <hi>Arius.</hi> Nay, ſome of the learnedſt Doctors in the preſent Roman Church, have taken a great deal of pains to make the World believe that <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> and a Number of other ancient Fathers, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with it. So uncertain they are in their Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes about theſe matters.</p>

But we have an Inſtance of this in the Roman Church it ſelf; where there is an acknowledged Change, and yet they themſelves are not able to tell who firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan it, becauſe it crept in by inſenſible Degrees. The Communion, I mean in one kind, was not uſed for above a thouſand years; but being begun in ſome Churches (they themſelves cannot tell which, nor when) grew to be a general Cuſtom not long before the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> in theſe Weſtern Parts of the World; and there was eſtabliſhed as a Law. But it did not begin by the Decree of any Biſhop, nor was carried on by any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Order, and if you ask them, who firſt ſet it on foot? they will tell you, that doth not appear.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the <hi>Second</hi> alone, of thoſe <hi>Six</hi> things, being proved, that new Doctrines and Practices have been brought in, of which we are very certain, there needs none of the reſt: But we are ſure there was a time, and Authors of them, and People that embraced them, though we ſhould not be able (for want of ancient Records that are loſt, or becauſe things that come in inſenſibly cannot in every Age be noted and recorded) to tell the very time, and Place and Perſons, when and where, and by whom they were introduced.</p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:104627:46"/>
                     <p>All which is not ſaid by us, becauſe we are not able to give an account of the other parts of that Ratiocinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but only to ſhew the Frivolouſneſs of ſuch Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as theſe, in which they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> place their main Retreat. For we can tell, nay, their own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have told us, when and by whom many things were brought into their Church, which were not there in the Beginning. <hi>Polydore Virgil,</hi> if I had room to inſert his Words, would furniſh us with ſeveral Inſtances. But I ſhall content my ſelf with <hi>Two,</hi> which were at no great diſtance the one from the other.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>First</hi> is their grand Article of Faith, about the Papal Authority. We know, and have often told them, by what ſteps it grew to the height, wherein now it is, or would be; when the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> began to exceed their Bounds; how they were oppoſed and ſnub'd, who, (and by whom,) was firſt declared the Univerſal Biſhop and Head of the Church. <hi>Victor</hi> began the Dance; <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zimus,</hi> after ſome others, followed it; <hi>Boniface</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued it; <hi>Celeſtine</hi> carried it on: Who met with ſo ſharp a Rebuke from the <hi>African</hi> Biſhops for his intruſion into their Affairs, upon the pretence of a forged Canon of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, as is ſufficient to ſhew his Ambition and Craft, was greater than his Authority. The Attempts of the reſt are as notorious, and ſo is the Oppoſition they met withall, till at laſt <hi>Boniface</hi> the 3d procured to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from <hi>Phocas,</hi> the Title of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Biſhop,</hi> and to his Church, the Title, <hi>of Head of all Churches.</hi> All this we can juſtify out of Authentick Records: but it is not in their Power to name ſo much as one Man that owned the Univerſal Juriſdiction of the Roman Biſhop over the whole Church, till that time; that is, till above ſix <hi>hundred years</hi> after our Saviour's Birth. For though <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> alledges an Epiſtle of <hi>Juſtinians,</hi> wherein he calls the Church of <hi>Rome, the Head of all Churches,</hi> yet is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:104627:47"/>nothing, but that they are at a loſs for want of Proofs; becauſe, as it is with great Reaſon ſuſpected to be ſpurious, ſo it can intend no more than Head of the Churches of the Weſt; becauſe in an undoubted Edict of his, he calls the Church of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> by the ſame Name, <hi>the Head of all other Churches, i.e.</hi> Chief of thoſe in the Eaſt. Which is ſo certain, that their own Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi> not much above a year before this arrogant Title was aſſumed, moſt vehemently diſdained it, or rather thundred againſt it. Nor can they name one Man in the whole Church for ſo long a time, that believed their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Definition of the Catholick Church; much leſs the Power of the Pope to depoſe Kings, which none challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged till <hi>Gregory</hi> VII, that is, till above a thouſand years after our bleſſed Saviour. Inſomuch that their fore-named Champion<note n="†" place="margin">C. <hi>Bellarm.</hi> Tract. de po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtate. Summ. Pontif. p. 27.</note> being to prove this depoſing Power, out of ancient Authors, is able to ſay no more than this, <hi>I have alledged above</hi> LXX <hi>famous Writers, ſome of which flouriſh'd more than</hi> 500 <hi>Years ago.</hi> A goodly Buſineſs! a glorious Shew of Antiquity! inſtead of the <hi>firſt five</hi> hundred Years after Chriſt, to refer us to the <hi>laſt five</hi> hundred: Which is to confeſs the Novelty of their moſt beloved Doctrines: And conſequently to quit this Note of <hi>Antiquity;</hi> as in Truth he plainly doth, in that Book, where being preſſed with this Argument, That no ſuch Power was claimed in the firſt Times of the Church; he anſwers,<note n="‖" place="margin">Ib. cap. 3. p. 69.</note> That <hi>he hath not right Conceptions of the Church of Chriſt, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits nothing but what he reads expreſly written or done in the ancient Church: For the Church of later time hath Power not only to explain, and declare, but conſtitute and command thoſe things which belong to Faith and Manners.</hi> Which is as much as to ſay, they need not trouble themſelves about Antiquity; for they can make Articles of Faith now, which were not heard of in the Beginning.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We have often alſo told them by what ſteps Images
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:104627:47"/>crept into the Church. For they remained at firſt only in private Houſes, for Ornament or for Commemoration, and not uncenſured: There being above 300 Years paſt before they came into any Church, and then not without Oppoſition; and for this end only to be of an <hi>Hiſtorical uſe,</hi> to remind People of things paſt. Which improved in 300 Years more, to a <hi>Rhetorical uſe</hi> (as we may call it) to ſtir up Devotion in the People. For which purpoſe <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great fancied they were profitable; and tho he by no means allowed them to be worſhipped, yet he thought the People might look upon them, and worſhip God before them. And this looking upon them to help Devotion, was improved in the time of the ſecond <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, into a downright worſhipping of them, which would not paſs in theſe Weſtern Parts for good Doctrine. And when at laſt (we know, and have told them by what ſteps) this new Worſhip advanced hither, and grew to a greater Degree of Religious Reſpect than that <hi>Nicene</hi> Council admitted; the moſt zealous Defenders of it could not agree about it, nor do they know what to make of it to this day.</p>
                     <p>We could tell them of other things that are much newer, for it is but a little more than 100 Years, ſince un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Traditions were decreed to be a part of the Rule of Faith, that is, of the Word of God. But this is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſhew that they vainly boaſt of <hi>Antiquity;</hi> which is only ancient Error, and ſome of it not very ancient neither. As for ancient Truth, that's on our ſide, whom they moſt injuriouſly accuſe of following Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. For the Religion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by Law eſtabliſhed, is the true Primitive Chriſtianity: In nothing <hi>New,</hi> unleſs it be in rejecting all that Novelty which hath been brought into the Church. But they are the Cauſe of that; for if they had not introduced
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:104627:48"/>new Articles, we ſhould not have had occcaſion for ſuch Articles of Religion as condemn them. Which cannot indeed be old, becauſe the Doctrines they condemn are new; tho the Principle upon which we condemn them is as old as Chriſtianity: we eſteeming all to be new, which was not from the Beginning. For as for our poſitive Doctrine, <hi>Polydore</hi> himſelf hath given a true Account of it, and makes it the Reaſon why the Sect called <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelick</hi> (as he ſpeaks) increaſed ſo marvelouſly in a ſhort time; <hi>becauſe they affirmed that no Law was to be received, which appertains to the Salvation of Souls, but that which Chriſt or the Apoſtles had given</hi>

                     <p>And who dare ſay that this is a new Religion, which is as old as Chriſt and his Apoſtles? With whom who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever agree, they are truly <hi>ancient</hi> Churches, tho of no longer ſtanding than Yeſterday: As they that diſagree with them are <hi>New,</hi> tho they can run up their Pedigree to the very Apoſtles.</p>

This might eaſily be proved againſt them through the fifteen Notes which are offered by them to the World: But I ſhall content my ſelf to give an Inſtance of it, in the Note of <hi>Duration,</hi> which is made by them a neceſſary Mark of the true Church.</p>

                     </list>
                     <p>§ I. <hi>Duration,</hi> according to <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> is the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of a Church throughout all Times without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption; and he adds, that the Catholick Church is ſo called, <hi>not only becauſe it always hath been, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it always will be.</hi> So that this <hi>Duration</hi> doth include in it theſe three Things:
<list>
                           <item>1. The Being of a Church from the Beginning.</item>
                           <item>2. The Continuance of that Church to the End.</item>
                           <item>3. The Continuance of that Church from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the End without Interruption.</item>

                     </p>
                     <p>Let us now ſee how he applies it to the Caſe. <hi>It's evident,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that our Church hath continued from the beginning of the World hitherto: Or, if we ſpeak of the State of the New Teſtament, it hath endured from Chriſt to this Year</hi> 1557. (The Year when he wrote this.) But for all his Beginning, <hi>its evident,</hi> there is no Proof of what he affirms, and his Aſſertion is very inſufficient.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That he takes it for granted that his Church and the Chriſtian Church are one and the ſame, and that there is no other true Church but his. <hi>It's evident our Church, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That he has omitted two main Branches of his <hi>Duration, viz.</hi> That part of it which was to the end of the World, which is as neceſſary a part as that which was from the Beginning: For the Church ſhall not
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:104627:49"/>continue to be as well as it hath been, it's not that Church which Duration is a Note of.</p>
                     <p>Again, He hath paſſed by that other Property of his Duration, <hi>viz.</hi> That it has been <hi>without Interruption.</hi> For if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was from the Beginning, and hath continued, but not <hi>without Interruption,</hi> it wants another Property of Duration; which always was, is, and always will be, and was, and will, and muſt be ſuch <hi>without Interruption,</hi> according to him.</p>
                     <p>§ II. How far is Duration a Note of the true Church. We grant that there ſhall always be a Church of Chriſt upon the Earth, and that the Gates of Hell ſhall never finally prevail againſt it, ſo as utterly to extinguiſh and deſtroy it: And this we firmly believe, becauſe Chriſt hath promiſed and undertaken for it. But though this is a Promiſe, and may ſupport the Church under the moſt doleful Circumſtances, yet it's no Note by which the true Church is to be found out and diſtinguiſhed from the falſe. For beſides that this Promiſe doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Exiſtence of a Church, and not to this or that Church;</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Nature of the Thing will not permit, that it ſhould be a Note. For a Promiſe reſpects the Time to come, but a Note reſpects the Time preſent. The Thing promiſed may become a Note, when it is actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fulfill'd, but till it be fulfill'd, it can no more be a Note, than the future Time is the preſent. For what a Promiſe is to the future, that is a Note to the preſent, and doth ſuppoſe the actual exiſtence of the Thing it is the Note of. And thus it is in the preſent Caſe: God hath promiſed that he will be with his Church and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it to the end of the World, but being the period of that Duration is not to be accompliſhed till the end

                        <pb n="60" facs="tcp:104627:51"/>of the World, the World muſt come to an end before we can know whether the Church pretending to Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be the true Church. Suppoſe we for once <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>'s Church to have continued (as he ſaith) for the Space of 1577 Years after our Saviour, and that it could be proved to a Demonſtration that it ſo long continued to be the ſame without Interruption; yet the time paſt is no proof for the time to come; and if the World ſhould continue 1577 Years after his time, and the Church nevertheleſs ſhould expire before that Term; the Term of 1577 Years paſt would no more anſwer this Character of perpetual Duration, than if it had endured but ſeven; for as he ſaith, <hi>Duration doth contain in it all Times, and excludes none.</hi> And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently if there was a Time or Caſe when that Durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was interrupted (as I ſhall ſhew it was) and a Time in which that Church ſhall ceaſe to be before Time it ſelf ſhall ceaſe (as it may for ought they can ſay againſt it) then either their Church would not be the true Church, or Duration not be the Note of the true Church. For that Duration including all Times, the future Time can be no more excluded than the Time paſt or preſent; but ſince the future is uncapable of Proof, the true Church cannot be proved by it, nor can Duration be a Note of it.</p>
                     <p>I grant indeed, that if Duration be a neceſſary Note of the true Church, this may be a Note by which thoſe Churches that once were, but are now utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, may be concluded not the true Church: but this Negative Argument will neither be able to ſhew which is the true Church, when there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pretend to the like Duration: nor can be a Note of the true Church, for the Reaſon before given, <hi>viz.</hi> that it reſpecting the future Succeſſion as well as the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:104627:51"/>paſt, it can be no Note till the time to come becomes preſent, and the whole Period of it be accompliſhed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That cannot be a Note of the true Church, which doth not inſeparably belong to the Church in all Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Caſes; for what is an eſſential Character of a thing belongs to that thing when-ever and where-ever it is: And if there be any Seaſon or Caſe in which that Note belongs not to it, that can be no true Note of the thing. As for inſtance, the Church in one Houſe or City immediately after our Saviour's Aſcenſion, was as much a Church from the firſt day it was ſo gathered, and had all the Qualifications of a Church, as it could have, had it been the Church of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtent 1577. And yet that Primitive Church ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted wanted this Note of Duration; for it then but began to be. And if a Perſon had been to enquire for the true Church by this Character and Token, and had been taught that that could be no Church which wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, he muſt have gone from the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Room</hi> to the Temple, and have been not a Chriſtian, but a Jew. So that we muſt conclude, that either the Church at that time had not all the Marks neceſſarily belonging to the true Church, and ſo indeed was no Church; or elſe that Duration is not an inſeparable Note of the true Church. The former Inference is good; becauſe that which has not all the Marks eſſentially belonging to the thing, cannot be the thing which they are the Marks of; but if that Apoſtolical Church had all the Marks eſſentially belonging to a true Church, and yet wanted at that time this Mark of Duration, then Duration cannot be an eſſential Note of the true Church, which was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing inferr'd.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That which is a Note, muſt be proper to the thing which it is the Note of, and not common to other

But now this Note of Duration is common to other things as well as the Church, to falſe Churches as well as the true, and ſo cannot be an eſſential Mark of the true Church, or a Note by which it's diſtinguiſhed and to be certainly known from the falſe. Suppoſe we that a Perſon that has imbibed this Principle, is in queſt of the true Church; and had been living when <hi>Luther</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd, and had before him the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> and <hi>Eutychi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> the <hi>Armenians, Egyptians,</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians</hi> in the Eaſt, the numerous Church of <hi>Greece,</hi> &amp;c. which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to a Duration as good and ſufficient as that of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the laſt of which is acknowledged by the Biſhop of <hi>Bitonto</hi> in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> to be the <hi>Mother of the Latin,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Orat. Concil. Trid.</note> 
                        <hi>and to which the Latin Church owes what it hath.</hi> How ſhall he be able to determine where he ſhall fix?<note place="margin">De Verb. Dei l. 2. c. ult.</note> For to ſay (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth) that they are Hereticks or Schiſmaticks, and that the <hi>Greek Church</hi> for Example, <hi>was lawfully convicted of Hereſie and Schiſm in three full Councils</hi> (that is,<note place="margin">De Not. c. 9. §. dico 2do.</note> Councils of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) will not make them not to have been, or that the Note of Duration belongs not to them. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then they muſt diſprove the Duration of thoſe Churches, or diſcharge it from being the diſtinguiſhing Note of the true Church.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, I may add; If Duration be the ſtanding Note or the true Church, Then thoſe could be no true Churches which have not had that Duration; and ſo they muſt un-Church the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> &amp;c. which have now no Exiſtence, but are utterly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed. For if they had been true Churches, they would have had Duration, but having not Duration they could not, according to this Doctrine, have ever
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:104627:52"/>been true Churches. But I am not willing thus to leave the Subject; and ſhall therefore,</p>
                     <p>§. III. Conſider whether the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> after all its pretence to Duration, and its eſtabliſhment of this Note of the true Church, has a juſt and ſufficient claim to it.</p>
                     <p>When we would know whether a Church has this Note of Duration belonging to it, we muſt conſider what there is in a Church that is capable of being tried by this Character, and that is either as to Place, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Order or Doctrine: for by theſe is it that the Church doth exiſt, and is made viſible; and ſo the Church that puts in a Claim to Duration, muſt be able to ſhew ſome Evidence for it from hence, as far as ſhe admits them for Inſtances of that Duration ſhe pleads for.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As to Place. When we hear ſo much of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it's to be ſuppoſed that <hi>Rome</hi> is the principal Seat of that Church, as well as the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> is the Head of it. But this they cannot pretend to Duration in: for if we look backward, we find not only the City of <hi>Rome</hi> frequently ſack'd and deſtroyed, and wholly depopulated, as it was by <hi>Alaricus, Genſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus</hi> and <hi>Totylas,</hi> but even deſerted by the Popes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who, with their whole Court, reſided at <hi>Avig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> for 70 Years together, as is acknowledged.<note place="margin">Bellarm. de Pontif. l. 4. c. 4."</note> If we look forward, all that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> dares to offer upon the Point, that <hi>the Chair of St.</hi> Peter <hi>ſhall not be ſeparated from</hi> Rome, is, that it's <hi>a pious and the moſt probable O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.</hi> But if we conſult others, they ſay poſitively,<note place="margin">Vega Jeſuita. in Apoc. 18. com. 7. §. 4.

                     </p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:104627:53"/>
                     <p n="2">2. If we proceed to Duration, as it reſpects Perſons, where ſhall we expect that to be intire and uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, if not in the Popes? And yet if we may judg of Popes as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth of a Church,<note place="margin">De Not. l. 4. c. 8. §. dico ſecundo.</note> and that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie doth nullify their Elections and Succeſſions as it doth the Verity of a Church, there is nothing more ſhattered. For if we look into the Catalogue of them, we ſhall find <hi>Zepherinus</hi> a Montaniſt, <hi>Marcellinus</hi> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing to Idols, <hi>Liberius</hi> and <hi>Faelix,</hi> Arrians, <hi>Anaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> a Neſtorian, <hi>Honorius</hi> a Monothelite, <hi>John</hi> 23. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying a future Life, with many others.</p>
                     <p>Go we on, and where ſhall we find more or greater Schiſms, one Pope curſing another, and undoing what his Predeceſſor had done, as was the Caſe of <hi>Formoſus, Romanus, Stephanus,</hi> and <hi>Sergius.</hi> Often two Popes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conteſting for the Chair (as it was for above forty Years at once) and at one time three Popes that had ſuch pretences to the Papacy, that each had Learned Men for their Patrons,<note place="margin">De Pontif. l. 4. c. 14. §. Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſimus ſepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</note> and it could not be eaſily judged which of them was the true and lawful Pope, as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> himſelf acknowledges.</p>
                     <p>But this belongs to Note five, of which more in its due place.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If we proceed to Order, either in Worſhip or Diſcipline, the Caſe is ſo notorious as to the ſeveral For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mularies uſed heretofore in that Church, that it needs not to be inſiſted upon, and it's impoſſible for them to deny it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Therefore I ſhall proceed to Doctrine, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the great Character by which a Church is to be diſcovered and tried. And here that I may not either intrench upon what has been ſaid before concerning the Variation of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this Point from the Scriptures,<note place="margin">

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:104627:53"/>further be ſaid upon Note nine. I ſhall compare the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with it ſelf, &amp; if I can therein prove that it is not now what it hath been in many main Points,<note place="margin">De Not. l. 4. c. 6. §. Quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis autem.</note> it will follow that it has no pretence to this Note of Duration, for upon this Point of <hi>Alteration</hi> doth <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> put the Iſſue.</p>

                     <p>By this Parallel thus far drawn betwixt the Ancient and Preſent Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we may be able to judg of the Immutability and Duration of the Church; which can no more be conſiſtent with it, than one part of a Contradiction can be reconciled to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or than Infallibility can be conſiſtent with the having actually err'd. To find fallible Churches miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, and at ſome times to vary from themſelves, is conſiſtent with their Nature, and for all which (if the Errors are not fundamental) they are Churches ſtill; but to find Errors and Contradictions in an Infallible Church, is to confound the nature of things, to give the Infallible Church no advantage over the Fallible, and to expoſe the Perſons that betake themſelves to that ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to all the Diſquietudes, Uncertainties, and Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments of Ignorance and Error. For what is the uſual Reaſon given for forſaking other Churches, but becauſe they are Fallible? What is the Reaſon why they go over to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but becauſe ſhe is (as they are made to believe) Infallible? But if with her Infallibility ſhe has miſtaken; if with her Certainty ſhe contradicts her ſelf; if ſhe was one thing in one Age, and another in another; then there is the ſame Reaſon to quit the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as there was to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it; and ſuch perſons muſt either be contented with a Church that is Fallible, or be of none.</p>

                     <p>WE could very willingly appeal to our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries themſelves, were they uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, whether a plainer Proof can be given of a Baffled Cauſe in a Controverſy relating to any Point of revealed Religion, than for the Aſſertors of it to decline maintaining it by thoſe Books, which alone can acquaint us with Divine Revelations. But 'tis Notorious that the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> are highly charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able upon this Account, in their Endeavours to perſuade the World, that <hi>theirs</hi> is the only true Church. They need not be told, that we are beholden to the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> for our having any Notion of ſuch a thing as a <hi>Church,</hi> and they and we are agreed that <hi>that</hi> only is the true <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> which profeſſeth the true <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:104627:58"/>an Faith:</hi> and therefore how is it poſſible they ſhould not be aware, that the beſt way to be ſatisfied whether thoſe, who challenge to themſelves the Title of the <hi>True and Catholick Church,</hi> have it really belonging to them, is, to examine their Faith by the Holy Scriptures? Which 'tis hard to imagine they can think to be <hi>ſo imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a Rule</hi> of Faith, as to believe it a juſtifiable thing to be ſo averſe to this Method, as we have ever found they are. This we of the <hi>Reformation</hi> have always ſtuck to, and we are deſirous of nothing more, than that it may be tryed by the Faith we profeſs, whether we are ſound Members of the Catholick Church, and the ſoundneſs of our Faith may be tryed by the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>But inſtead of taking this Courſe, thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion have invented and do inſiſt on a Company of Notes and Characters of the Church, which are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not to be met with, or are far from being plainly delivered, in Scripture. Had this been <hi>our</hi> practice, I appeal to their own Conſciences, whether they could have imputed it to a better Cauſe, than our being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to our ſelves of the diſagreeableneſs of our Faith with the Doctrine of Scripture, and our not daring to have it brought to this Touch-ſtone.</p>
                     <p>Of this ſort of Notes Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath given us no fewer than <hi>Fifteen,</hi> among which he could afford no Place to this Note of ours; though 'tis as evident as the Light, that this one alone would have ſignified much more to his Purpoſe, than all <hi>that</hi> long Bead-roul put together.</p>
                     <p>The Deſign of this Diſcourſe is to examine his <hi>Fourth</hi> Note, viz. <hi>Amplitudo, ſive Multitudo &amp; Varietas Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentium. Amplitude, or Multitude and Variety of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</hi> And how far he makes it to extend, his next Words inform us, viz. <hi>Eccleſia enim verè Catholica, non
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:104627:58"/>ſolum debet amplecti omnia Tempora, ſed etiam omnia Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, omnes Nationes, omnia Hominum Genera. The truly Catholick Church ought not only to comprehend all Ages, but alſo all Places, all Nations, and all Sorts of Men.</hi> And,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> He endeavours to prove <hi>this</hi> to be a true Note.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> To make it to belong to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to her alone.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To perſwade us that thoſe particularly who call themſelves the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches, can lay no claim to it.</p>
                     <p>And it ſhall be my Buſineſs,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> To ſhew that this cannot be a Note of the true Church. And,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Suppoſing it to be ſo, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will however gain nothing by it, as to her Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; nor the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches loſe any thing: Nay on the contrary, that it will quite overthrow her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of being the whole Catholick Church, and do the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches as great Service, as <hi>Her</hi> Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> I will briefly ſhew, that this cannot be a Note of the true Church. By a <hi>Note</hi> is underſtood a <hi>diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Character;</hi> but <hi>this</hi> is ſuch a Character of the true Church as no one could <hi>leſs</hi> diſtinguiſh it: And that, whether we conſider the Members thereof under, either the notion of a great <hi>Multitude,</hi> or a great Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of <hi>Believers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Conſidering them under the Notion of a great <hi>Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> the Church which is <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Kingdom, is far from being diſtinguiſhable as <hi>ſuch</hi> from the Kingdom of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> which was always incomparably more numerous:
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:104627:59"/>Or from that part of it which conſiſteth of <hi>Idolatrous Pagans.</hi> What <hi>Romaniſt</hi> can boaſt of his <hi>Church,</hi> in reference to this Note, as <hi>Demetrius</hi> the <hi>Silver-Smith</hi> did of his <hi>Diana,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>That all Aſia and the World worſhipped her?</hi> Nor can the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by the Number of its Members be diſtinguiſhed from the Worſhippers of that great Impoſtor <hi>Mahomet;</hi> which the Sons of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church muſt eſpecially grant to be far exceeding the Members of Chriſt's true Church in Number, ſince they make <hi>themſelves</hi> the only Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.</p>
                     <p>Again, conſidering them under the Notion of a great Multitude of <hi>Believers,</hi> there was an Age in which the <hi>Orthodox</hi> Chriſtians could not be diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Hereticks,</hi> by the greatneſs of their Number (whom the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will not admit to be Members of the Church in any ſenſe) for in the Reign of <hi>Arrianiſm, ingenuit Orbis &amp; mirabatur &amp;c. The World lamented and wondred to find it ſelf turned Arrian;</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Hierom.</hi> And it became a Proverb, <hi>Athanaſius againſt the whole World, and the whole World againſt Athanaſius.</hi> And laſtly, the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not to be <hi>thus</hi> diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from the Kingdom of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> I wiſh our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries could impartially conſider, <hi>whoſe</hi> Note that of <hi>having Power given him over all Kindreds and Tongues and Nations</hi> is moſt likely to be:<note place="margin">Apoc. 13.7.</note> And <hi>who</hi> it is that is deſcribed by <hi>ſitting, as upon ſeven Hills, ſo upon many Waters:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Chap. 17.1.</note> Which Waters are <hi>Peoples, and Multitudes, and Nations,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Verſ. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>and Tongues.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe things conſidered, nothing is more apparent, than that the true Church is neither to be diſtinguiſhed from other Bodies of Men, or of Profeſſors of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, by the largeneſs of its Extent, or the Numerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its Members; and therefore that a true Note
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:104627:59"/>thereof cannot reſult from theſe. And beſides, a true Note of the Church muſt be Eſſential to it, muſt belong thereto <hi>as</hi> the true Church, and therefore is inſeparable from it. But how could Amplitude or Multitude, be aſcribed to the true Church in the Time of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> when he called it <hi>a little Flock,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Strait is the Gate and narrow is the Way that leadeth unto Life, and few there be that find it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Bellarmin</hi> pretends to fetch this Note of his out of the <hi>Bible,</hi> and not only to be beholden to <hi>Vincenſius Lyrinenſis</hi> for it, whom he firſt cites in favour of it; tho little to his Purpoſe, as will be ſeen anon. The <hi>Texts</hi> he produceth are <hi>four; two</hi> in the <hi>Old</hi> Teſtament and <hi>two</hi> in the <hi>New.</hi> Thoſe in the <hi>Old</hi> Teſtament are, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.8. Where God the Father promiſeth his Son, That <hi>He will give him the Heathen for his Inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the Earth for his Poſſeſſion.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.8. Where 'tis propheſied, That Chriſt <hi>ſhall have Dominion from Sea to Sea, and from the River unto the Ends of the Earth.</hi> Thoſe in the <hi>New</hi> Teſtament are, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.47. Where our Lord declareth, That <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Remiſſion of Sins ſhould be preached in his Name among all Nations, beginning at Jeruſalem.</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi> 1.8. Where he tells his Apoſtles, That <hi>they ſhall receive Power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon them, and they ſhall be Witneſſes unto him, both in Jeruſalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermoſt parts of the Earth.</hi> And it cannot be doubted but that theſe Texts do prove, that the Members of Chriſt's Church ſhall be a very vaſt Multitude, and that its Amplitude ſhould even extend over all the World. But neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It doth not from hence follow, that the Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Amplitude and Multitude doth make a Note,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:104627:60"/>or diſtinguiſhing Character, of Chriſt's true Church. It is <hi>one</hi> thing to ſay, it belongs thereto as an Attribute; and <hi>another,</hi> that 'tis appropriated to it as a Note. That may be even Eſſential to a Thing, which yet is not a Note of Diſtinction, or peculiar Property, whereby it may be known from all <hi>other</hi> Things. The power of Senſation is eſſential to a Man, yet for all that, he is not diſtinguiſhable thereby from a Beaſt. But it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from what hath been diſcourſed, that the true Church is not to be diſtinguiſh'd from the Kingdom of <hi>Satan,</hi> nor of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> nor from <hi>Erroneous Sects,</hi> by Amplitude and Multitude: And that theſe together, or apart, are not ſo much as Eſſential to the Church of Chriſt; ſince there was a time when, as hath been ſaid, it was without them both.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This is ſo far from being a Note of the Church, that 'tis no more than a variable State and Condition thereof; ſince it hath had, from time to time, its Ebbs and Flows, and hath had ſometimes larger, and other times ſtraiter and narrower Bounds. This the <hi>Cardinal</hi> was aware of, and therefore, among other things he would have to be obſerved for the right underſtanding of this his Note, he ſaith, That <hi>Although the Church ought not neceſſarily to be in all places at the ſame time, yet now it ought neceſſarily to be, or to have been, in the greater part of the World: For 'tis acknowledged by all, even the Hereticks themſelves</hi> (meaning the Proteſtants) <hi>that the Church is now in her old Age, and therefore muſt be paſt growing.</hi> By the way; though all his Hereticks, no doubt, do believe that the Church hath daily grown elder and elder, yet I know not how many he hath found aſſerting, that ſhe is now arrived at old Age. But it will by no means be granted him, that the Church is yet grown ſo old as to be paſt growing, or to have a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:104627:60"/>period put to its time of Encreaſing. And therefore I add,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That we have great Aſſurance that the Church hitherto hath not deſerved to be compared with what it ſhall be before the end of the World, both in reſpect of its Amplitude, and the number of Believers. For there are very many plain Prophecies from whence this may certainly be concluded; which all, that without prejudice conſider them, muſt needs be ſatisfied, have not hitherto been accompliſhed. Namely, thoſe which have reference to the <hi>Calling of the Jews,</hi> and the <hi>bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of the fulneſs of the Gentiles, and the moſt plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Effuſion of the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>perfect reſt from Perſecution,</hi> and <hi>univerſal Peace,</hi> with the moſt wonderful outward Proſperity of the Church. There are, I ſay, abundance of the plaineſt Predictions and Promiſes of this Nature, which the Church hath not as yet experimented the performance of; and they are expreſſed in ſuch Words as that it may reaſonably be believed, that thoſe great things which God hath heretofore done for his Church, either <hi>Jewiſh</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> are no better than Types and Emblems of what he intends to do, in His appointed time. Among thoſe Predictions and Promiſes, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may conſult theſe following, which are but a few in companion of the whole Number, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Old Teſtament, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.27 <hi>to</hi> 31. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.1 <hi>to</hi> 6. <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>throughout. Jer.</hi> 32.37 <hi>to</hi> 43. <hi>Chap.</hi> 33.7 <hi>to the end. Dan.</hi> 7.13, 14. And in the New Teſtament, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.12. <hi>and ver.</hi> 25 <hi>to</hi> 33.2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.15, 16. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.1 <hi>to</hi> 7. Though the fulfilling of theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures hath been deferred for ſo many Ages, yet He is <hi>Faithful that hath promiſed</hi> ſo glorious an encreaſe of His Church, with the other unſpeakable Bleſſings now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and will fulfil them when the Time is come
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:104627:61"/>which His infinite Wiſdom knows to be the fitteſt for that Purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>And thus much may ſuffice to be ſaid in reference to the Cardinal's proving this Note by <hi>Scripture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to thoſe Words, in the next place, of <hi>Vincenſius Lyrinenſis,</hi> in his <hi>Commonitorium,</hi> which he produceth for the confirming thereof, viz. <hi>Eos propriè eſſe Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos, qui tenent id quod ſemper, quod ubique, quod ab omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus creditum eſt. Thoſe are properly Catholicks, who hold that which hath been always, every where, and by all believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> I anſwer,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That <hi>Vincenſius</hi> doth not pretend to give us, in theſe Words, a Note of the Catholick <hi>Church,</hi> but of ſuch a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> This is evident at firſt ſight: And ſo is this,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Whereas he makes it the Character of a true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, to hold what hath been believed <hi>ſemper, ubique &amp; omnibus,</hi> it cannot be hence inferred, that he believed Amplitude, or a Multitude of Believers to be ſo much as an Attribute of the Catholick Church; and therefore much leſs a Note.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If theſe Words lay down a true Note of a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Chriſtian, then no Body of Chriſtians can be more evidently proved to be no true Catholicks, than thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion may, in all thoſe Articles of Faith which are peculiar to themſelves. For, as to Points of mere Belief, how much more than the <hi>Apoſtles Creed</hi> can they ſhew us to have been received, <hi>always, every where, and by all Chriſtians?</hi> But as for that large Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Tridentine</hi> Articles, annexed to that Creed by P. <hi>Pius</hi> the 4th, no unbiaſſed Perſon can believe, they have ever done any thing <hi>like</hi> proving, that any of them have been received <hi>always,</hi> and much leſs <hi>every where,</hi> and by all thoſe whom themſelves own for Catholick Chriſtians.</p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:104627:61"/>
                     <p n="4">4. By this Note of a Catholick, no Society of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans can bid ſo fair for Catholiciſm, as the Reformed Churches, but eſpecially the Church of <hi>England;</hi> whoſe avowed Principle it is, <hi>to receive nothing as an Article of Faith, but what is contained in the holy Scriptures,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Artic. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>or may be proved thereby.</hi> Nor doth ſhe embrace any one Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as an <hi>Article of Faith,</hi> but what is clearly expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in thoſe Books, of whoſe Canonicalneſs there never was the leaſt Diſpute in the Primitive Church.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly.</hi> I proceed to ſhew that if we ſhould acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg this to be a true Note of the Catholick Church; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of enabling the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to make good her Pretenſion of ſo being, it will deſtroy it: And inſtead of doing Diſſervice to the Reformed Churches, it will do them excellent Service, and be a certain Argument of their being true Parts of the Catholick Church. And,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I will ſhew that it will not at all Advantage the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as to that her Pretenſion, and therefore can do <hi>us</hi> no Prejudice. The Cardinal proves,</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) <hi>That his Church began to fructify throughout the World in the Days of the Apoſtles,</hi> from theſe Words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Col. 1.6. <hi>The Truth of the Goſpel is come unto you, as it is in all the World, and bringeth forth Fruit, as it doth alſo in you,</hi> &amp;c. But what is this to <hi>his</hi> Church? Is the Goſpel's bringing forth Fruit in all the World, the ſame thing with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s ſo doing?</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) He adds the Authority of ſeveral <hi>Fathers,</hi> for this Church's being ſpread in <hi>their</hi> Time, all over the then known World, but gives us none of their Sayings except St. <hi>Proſper</hi>'s. The firſt Father he cites is St. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi> in the 3d Chapter of his Book.<note place="margin">Edit. <hi>Pariſ.</hi> p. 53.</note> But the Father here only ſaith, <hi>That this Faith</hi> (which he ſums up immediately before, and is but the chief part of the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:104627:62"/>
                        <hi>Apoſtle's Creed</hi>) <hi>the Church diſſeminated throughout the World diligently preſerves, as if it were confined but to one Houſe.</hi> But how doth this concern the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Which is not once mentioned with others here parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly named; except we could be made to believe that whereſoever the Word <hi>Church</hi> is found, <hi>that</hi> Church is ſtill to be underſtood. Next he cites <hi>Tertullian adversùs Judaeos,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Edit. <hi>Rig.</hi> p. 189.</note> and having ſearch'd that Book, <hi>theſe,</hi> or <hi>none,</hi> are the Words he means, viz. <hi>Thoſe Words of</hi> David <hi>are to be underſtood of the</hi> Apoſtle's, <hi>their Sound is gone forth in all the Earth, and their Words unto the End of the World: For in whom have all Nations believed, but in</hi> Chriſt, <hi>who is now come? The</hi> Parthians, Medes, Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, <hi>and thoſe that inhabit</hi> Meſopotamia, Armenia, Phrygia, Cappadocia, Pontus, Aſia <hi>and</hi> Pamphilia, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, Africa, <hi>and beyond</hi> Cyrene, <hi>the</hi> Romans <hi>and</hi> Jews <hi>now in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and other Nations; as now of the</hi> Getu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li <hi>and</hi> Moors, <hi>all</hi> Spain, <hi>divers Countries of the</hi> Gauls, <hi>and thoſe of the</hi> Britains, <hi>which the</hi> Romans <hi>could never conquer, are ſubject to Christ,</hi> &amp;c. But I again ask, What is all this to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> more than to any other particular Church belonging to any one of the many Nations, of which that of the <hi>Romans</hi> is one, and two whole Quarters of the World, here mentioned? His <hi>third Father</hi> is St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Edit. <hi>Oxon.</hi> p. 10<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>.</note> in his Book <hi>de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitate Eccleſiae.</hi> But here is nothing he could fancy to be for his purpoſe, except <hi>theſe</hi> Words: <hi>The Church is one, which by its Fruitfulneſs is extended into a Multitude; As there are many Rays of the Sun, and but one Light,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So the Church of our Lord, which being filled with Light, ſends forth her Beams through the whole World, is but one Light, which is diffuſed every-where.</hi> But though this be ſaid of the Catholick Church; is here the leaſt Intimation that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is this Catholick Church? After
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:104627:62"/>St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> follow ſeveral of the <hi>later Fathers,</hi> their Books being only directed to. But the narrow room I am confined to, will not permit me to examine them; nor need we look any farther to be ſatisfied, how this greateſt Man of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church condeſcended to the moſt ſhameful impertinence, in citing Scripture and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for the doing her Service. But we muſt not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look St. <hi>Proſper</hi>'s Verſes, in his Book <hi>de Ingratis, viz.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <lg>
                              <l>Sedes Roma Petri, quae Paſtoralis Honoris</l>
                              <l>Facta Caput Mundo, quicquid non poſſidet Armis,</l>
                              <l>Relligione tenet— <hi>i. e.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>But, conſidering how early this Father lived, <hi>viz.</hi> about the beginning of the <hi>Fifth</hi> Century, he could mean no more than <hi>this,</hi> That the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the moſt Honourable of all other (by means of that Cities being the ancient Seat of the Emperors) keeps ſtill poſſeſſion of thoſe places by the Religion they received from Her, over which ſhe hath loſt Her Old Dominion. And what is this, but <hi>another</hi> plain Inſtance, of moſt idle quoting of Ancient Authors? Not to reflect upon <hi>Fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arguments from Poetical Flouriſhes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But, not to ſtand to conſider <hi>how</hi> Ample the <hi>Roman</hi> Church was in the times of thoſe Fathers, nothing is more evident, than that <hi>that</hi> part of Chriſtendom ſhe took up, was but a ſmall Spot of Ground compared with the Space <hi>thoſe</hi> Churches filled; which, tho they held Communion with Her, were <hi>distinct</hi> Churches from Her, and owned no Subjection to Her. And it was about,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:104627:63"/>or above, an <hi>Hundred</hi> Years after the <hi>youngeſt</hi> of thoſe Fathers, that the Pope was inverted by that Execrable Wretch <hi>Phocas</hi> (a Bleſſed Title in the mean time) with the Primacy over all Churches. And <hi>Gregory the Great,</hi> who died in the Beginning of the <hi>Sixth</hi> Century, not only ſharply inveighed againſt <hi>John</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> and his Succeſſor <hi>Cyriacus,</hi> for aſſuming to themſelves the Title of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Biſhops</hi> (though there was no appearance of their deſigning any thing more thereby, than an Addition of <hi>Honour</hi> (not of <hi>Power</hi>) to that Patriarchate) but alſo called thoſe who ſhould affect ſuch a Haughty Title,<note place="margin">Greg. Epiſt. 37. &amp; 70. <hi>lib.</hi> 11. &amp; Ep. 30. <hi>l.</hi> 4.</note> the <hi>Forerunners of Antichriſt.</hi> And, as theſe Biſhops taking this Title, was a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that they acknowledged not the leaſt Subjection to the Biſhops of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſo Pope <hi>Gregory</hi>'s calling thoſe Biſhops who ſhould ſo do, without Exception, <hi>Forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Antichrist,</hi> is as plain a Proof, that the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>his</hi> time, did not look on themſelves as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Primacy over all Churches. And 'tis manifeſt that in the time of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was not thought to include the Catholick Church, or to be any more than one part thereof: This, I ſay, is manifeſt from the <hi>Sixth Canon</hi> of that Council, viz. <hi>Let the ancient Cuſtoms be preſerved, for the Biſhop of</hi> Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria <hi>to have Juriſdiction over</hi> Egypt, Lybia and Pentapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis; <hi>becauſe the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>hath a like Cuſtom, &amp;c.</hi> Which is as much as to ſay, that the Biſhop of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> had then the ſame uncontroulable Power in his large Juriſdiction, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had in <hi>his.</hi> And therefore <hi>that</hi> Council knew nothing of <hi>this</hi> Biſhop's ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any Power over the <hi>Alexandrian,</hi> and much leſs over the <hi>whole Catholick</hi> Church. Nor is any thing more certain, than that the mere Superiority of <hi>Honour,</hi> which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church had, was founded on no Divine
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:104627:63"/>Right, but only on <hi>that Cities</hi> being the Seat of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. For, as the <hi>Second General Council,</hi> viz. that of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> decreed in its <hi>Third Canon,</hi> That the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſhould have the priviledg of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <hi>next</hi> to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> upon the account of its being the Imperial City, and therefore called <hi>New Rome:</hi> So in the <hi>Twenty eighth Canon</hi> of the <hi>Fourth Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council, viz.</hi> that of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> it was ordained, that for the <hi>ſame</hi> Reaſon, the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſhould have <hi>equal</hi> priviledges with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> So that 'tis a plain Caſe, that whoſoever ſhall undertake to prove from any Sayings of the Ancients, for the firſt 500 Years at leaſt, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church were reputed to be the <hi>ſame,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that whatſoever they ſaid of the Amplitude of <hi>this</hi> is to be underſtood of <hi>that</hi> Church, muſt neceſſarily make as ſad work of it, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> hath here done. And therefore it is apparent too, that no Service can be done to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by this <hi>Note,</hi> as to her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of being the true, Catholick Church: From whence it will likewiſe follow, that no <hi>prejudice</hi> can from thence accrue to the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches. But this is not all; For,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This Note, were it a true one, would be <hi>Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive</hi> to that her Pretence, and do the Reformed Churches great <hi>Service, viz.</hi> in demonſtrating them to be true parts of the Catholick Church. <hi>This</hi> alſo may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from what hath been ſaid, but it will be made <hi>more</hi> evident by theſe following Conſiderations.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had as Ample a Spread over the World, for ſome of the firſt Ages, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for, <hi>this</hi> would far more redound to the Advantage of our Churches of the Reformation (were <hi>Amplitude</hi> a diſtinguiſhing Property of the Church) than to the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:104627:64"/>Advantage of the preſent Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe that Church <hi>then</hi> was more <hi>ours,</hi> than now it is the <hi>Romaniſts.</hi> For there can ſcarcely be a greater Diſagreement in <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> and <hi>Worſhip</hi> between any two <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches, than there hath for a long time been between the <hi>ſame</hi> Church as ſhe was <hi>then,</hi> and is <hi>now.</hi> But the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is as great between the Ancient Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>our</hi> Churches; and eſpecially between Her and the Church of <hi>England.</hi> This our Adverſaries could not but ſee, would they impartially compare the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Worſhip</hi> of each together. And the only Quarrel they have with us, is, that we will not admit more into <hi>our Creed,</hi> than the Chriſtians of the Firſt Ages did into <hi>theirs:</hi> And that we worſhip God only by the alone Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, as <hi>they</hi> did: That our Laity partake of the Communion in both kinds, as <hi>theirs</hi> did. And, in ſhort, that we believe the Holy Scriptures to be a compleat Rule of Faith, as it was every where belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be by the Primitive Catholicks; and that we will not receive into our Worſhip the <hi>Roman</hi> Novelties; thoſe things which were utterly unknown to both the <hi>Roman</hi> and all <hi>other</hi> Churches in <hi>thoſe</hi> Ages.</p>
                     <p>Now, whereas the <hi>Cardinal</hi> would have it obſerved, for the better explaining the meaning of this Note, <hi>That if one Province alone ſhould retain the true Faith, it might properly be called the Catholick Church, ſo long as its Faith is one and the ſame, with that which at one time or other had prevailed in the whole World:</hi> We deſire no greater Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to <hi>our</hi> Church, and all other in Communion with Her; ſince <hi>theſe</hi> and <hi>thoſe</hi> Churches which in the Primitive Times were extended all over the then known parts of the World, are agreed in much more than all the Fundamental Points of Faith.</p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:104627:64"/>
                     <p n="2">2. It hath been eſtimated upon Computation, that the Churches ſubject to the <hi>Roman See</hi> exceed not much the Reformed Churches in Amplitude, or Multitude of Members: Eſpecially ſince <hi>Italy, Spain,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">See the <hi>Preface</hi> to <hi>Brerewood</hi>'s Enquiries.</note> and <hi>Portugal</hi> are detained in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, not by Choice or Judgment, but by Ignorance and the Tyranny of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition. But who can be ignorant that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> bears not the leaſt proportion upon thoſe Accounts, with theſe Churches conſidered in <hi>Conjunction</hi> with that part of Chriſtendom which agreeth with them, as in all the main Points of Chriſtianity, ſo in refuſing Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to <hi>that</hi> Church; and in moſt of thoſe Doctrines and Practices, which we condemn in Her as contrary to Holy Scripture, or as not founded thereon (and yet made neceſſary to Salvation by Her) and not taught by the Primitive Church? So that ſhould all the Churches which deny that of <hi>Rome</hi> to have any Authority over them, deal with <hi>Her</hi> as ſhe hath dealt with <hi>them,</hi> and pronounce Her to have nothing more left Her than the mere <hi>Name</hi> of a Church; this Her Note would be an unanſwerable Objection againſt Her being <hi>A true Church,</hi> as well as <hi>The true Church;</hi> on ſuppoſition that (as ſhe holds) of two Parties of Chriſtians rejecting Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with, and unchurching each other, but one of them can be a <hi>true Church.</hi> That ſo large a part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, I ſay, agrees with the Reformed Churches in all the Grand Articles of Faith, and in the Chief of thoſe wherein they are at Varience with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as makes the whole an incomparably greater Body of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers than all thoſe <hi>together</hi> who own that Church for their Mother, is ſo notorious, that 'tis impoſſible our Adverſaries ſhould diſpute it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cardinal</hi> indeed tells us, on this Note, That <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all</hi> Italy <hi>and</hi> Spain <hi>and almoſt all</hi> France, <hi>which the

And for the ſmall knowledg we have of any of the reſt at the Beginning, or of what paſt among them for ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after St. <hi>Clemens,</hi> we are beholden to the Writers of other Churches: This ſo famous Church ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving left none for ſome conſiderable time (that I know of) except the <hi>Decretal</hi> Epiſtles, as termed, be called in: Which the moſt ingenuous among them, will ſcarce own for any other than ſpurious, or doubtful at beſt; and yet what great ſtreſs has been laid on them? And ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting alſo the very little Remains in other Authors. If they, or others for them, have been more accurate in preſerving the Memorials of the lineal Deſcent of their Biſhops than moſt Churches (though Learned Men are not yet agreed neither among themſelves, or us, about the exact Order of the very firſt of them.) Yet I ſuppoſe the other <hi>Patriarchal Seats</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople, Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> to mention no more, will think themſelves as ſecure of their own Pedigree, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation liable to as few Exceptions.</p>

                     <p>For if the Charge of <hi>Hereſy</hi> break the Connection of this Chain which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> here objects againſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> It will be as hard for him to clear the like more notorious Objections againſt <hi>Liberius, Vigilius,</hi> and <hi>Honorius,</hi> to mention nothing of later <hi>Popes,</hi> whoſe very Groſs Errors, if not Blaſphemies, if they muſt not come under that Name, yet certainly ſome of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve every whit as bad, being as deſtructive to all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; wherein may be conſulted their own Writers of their Lives: I take no delight to ſearch after ſuch Matters.

                     <p>Theſe and ſuch like Accidents, what ever Difficulties, to know who had the beſt Title, they may afford not eaſy to be cleared from him that had a mind to ſeek Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections: Yet ſeeming for the main no more than what the Intricacies, and Perplexities of the Current of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Affairs have been ever expoſed to, I ſhould not have taken notice of, had not the Foundation of all Truth or Certainty, and the perpetual duration of the Church of Chriſt been thought only with ſafety to be placed upon the ſuppos'd Rock of the Stability of this Chair, and Indefectibility of this Church, and, with many, the Infallibility of him that preſides therein. And were they not ſo Bold, to ſay no more, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe very ſtrange and extraordinary Rules or Meaſures to the ſupream Providence in the Conduct thereof, whatever becomes of any other, or elſe all muſt be loſt.</p>
                     <p>We acknowledg the wonderful Providence of God in the preſervation of His Faith, and Church, as much from the Corruptions of its own Members, as from the Violence, and Policies of its profeſs'd Enemies: But we dare not be ſo preſumptuous as to challenge our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour with being wanting to his Promiſe, or complain we want any needful Security to our Faith, or that there is any defect in the Authority or Miniſtrations of our Spiritual Guides, if any particular Perſon or ſet Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them may poſſibly be liable to miſtake in matters
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:104627:71"/>of Faith, or determine otherwiſe than they ought, or prove falſe to their Truſt. It is a very unſafe, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten fallacious way of arguing, however popular, and that needs leſs Trouble in Examination, from Perſons to things, whereas <hi>theſe</hi> will continue the ſame, but <hi>they</hi> are changeable.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. But then it may be obſerved of the Roman Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, that the caſe ſeems ſo <hi>extremely chang'd ſince the firſt Times.</hi> So great an Alteration there is in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and in the Office to which the Succeſſion is now come, that it can hardly be look'd on as the continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſame. The <hi>Epiſcopal Power</hi> is all that we can find for ſome hundred of years laid claim to, and our Note is only concerned in it, tho in ſome few ſingle Acts it began by degrees to be ſtretch'd, ſo as to put other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops upon their Guard and Proteſtations, as in the caſe of <hi>Appeals</hi> by the <hi>Africans.</hi> Yet were all Biſhops ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to have an equal ſhare in that; all to be of like Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Authority, all alike Succeſſors of the Apoſtles, whether at <hi>Rome</hi> or in the meaneſt City, as in the known Teſtimonies in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> &amp;c. But the Papal Power now challenged and exerciſed is ſo vaſtly and widely different from Epiſcopacy, that ſcarce any Propriety of Speech can bring them under the ſame Name.</p>
                     <p>But to come to matter of Fact. Notwithſtanding the high Elogiums given by the Antients, on particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar occaſions, to the Roman Church or Biſhops, and the very bold Efforts, and very lofty Aſpirings of ſome of theſe, yet he muſt have other Eyes, or other Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles than we can procure, who can eſpy any thing like the <hi>Supremacy</hi> and Authority claim'd by the preſent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy in the Principles, or Practice of the Church for
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:104627:72"/>more than <hi>five hundred Years,</hi> which (as hath been obſerved) could not but have been as diſcernable in all the Hiſtories of thoſe Times, as the Reference to the power of our Kings, and manner of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment muſt be in our own Hiſtory.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Farther indeed there ſeems no great Reaſon for them to be much concerned at the Succeſſion of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, that are not very favourable to the very Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. We know what great Oppoſition in their <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> the <hi>Divine Right of Epiſcopacy</hi> met with from the chief Favourites of that See, when the Determination was ſo ſtrongly preſſed by others.<note place="margin">De Pont. Rom. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 8, 9. <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 24.</note> And the Author of theſe Notes is pleated to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the Government of the Church not to be chiefly in the Biſhops, but properly and intirely <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical, in the Pope only,</hi> and that he derives his Power immediately from Chriſt: But the Biſhops have theirs from him as to Juriſdiction, which is Government.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Moreover they have the leſs reaſon to except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any Churches for the want of this Apoſtolical Order, when their very <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> that multiplies Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with much leſs Diſtinction of Office, makes this <hi>no diſtinct Order,</hi> but only a different <hi>Degree</hi> of the ſame Prieſthood, the ſupreme Order in their Church, aſcending only gradually from that of a common Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter to that of Biſhops, Arch-Biſhops, Patriarchs, and the Pope himſelf. Some of the intermediate we know admit no diſtinct Ordination: Nay, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended plenary Power of the Pope hath ſometimes by particular Delegation empowered mitred Abbots, but meer Presbyters, to ſupply the Place of two of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, if but one be preſent even in Ordination it ſelf,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:104627:72"/>and that of a Biſhop, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in this very Note yields. Many other Inſtances might be given of their endeavours to advance the firſt as it were on purpoſe to fence off the danger of a Rival. To what uſe elſe ſhould ſerve ſo many Priviledges and Exemptions, long complained of? Their chief Riſe hath been upon the Depreſſion of Biſhops, and robbing them of their ordinary Power. So quite oppoſite is the true caſe from the Jelouſies of ſome about this Primitive Order.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Alſo they will have little cauſe to glory much in this pretended uninterrupted Succeſſion, when they conſider how many <hi>Nullities,</hi> according to their own Principles, may diſſolve and ſeparate the cloſest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion thereof. For beſides confuſed Tumultuary, and Simoniacal Promotions, from which their own Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters will ſcarce free ſome of them, That one Principle of <hi>the Intention of the Prieſt,</hi> being neceſſary to the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of any Sacrament, had need make them fearful of relying too much upon it. For in caſe this were once wanting in ſome of the principal Sources, through ſo long a Tract of time, variety of Circumſtances, and different Temper of Perſons, which many will think no hard matter to ſuppoſe, however can never be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly proved otherwiſe; by this Rule they cannot be ſecure of any Order, yea ſcarce of any true Chriſtian among them.</p>
                     <p>So I proceed to the <hi>Third Inquiry,</hi> How inſufficient a Proof this will afford them of any Great Advantage?<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Inquiry</hi> 3.</note> Indeed <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf ſeems ſo Juſt, as, in part, to yield this in his Anſwer to the Fourth Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this <hi>Note.</hi> He ſays an Argument may be brought that there the Church is not, where there is not this
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:104627:73"/>Succeſſion; but it cannot thence neceſſarily be gathered, that there the Church is, whereſoever this Succeſſion is: So that it ſeems no poſitive Proof with him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thinks fit to exclude the <hi>Eaſtern Churches,</hi> or break their Succeſſion upon pretences of <hi>Hereſy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> This Succeſſion is no ſufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of the Truth of the Doctrine of any Church. Indeed were <hi>Tradition</hi> ſo infallible a Conveyance of Truth, as ſome Men that talk of nothing below Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, would vouch: Were it impoſſible for any new Opinion to creep into the Church: Were it neceſſary that Men muſt believe to Day as they did Yeſterday; and ſo in ſhort as it were at one Leap, up to the very Apoſtles, and that the paſſage of ſixteen hundred years were able to make as little Alterations in the Memorials, or Evidences of what Doctrines or Rules of Practice were firſt delivered by word of Mouth, as the laſt Nights ſleep does of what paſs'd the Day before; Then every Church of Apoſtolical Foundation (and ſuch were all then Planted) had been, and would ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue as Infallible as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> thinks her ſelf, and we ſhould not have had any diſpute about their Tenets, nor any ſuch Exceptions againſt their Succeſſion. What Security theirs hath from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections which others are charged with, or have been found liable to; what Evidence may be produc'd that any Church, or Company of Men in the Church, may not add in proceſs of Time ſome Doctrines and Uſages very prejudicial to the Common Faith once delivered to the Saints: And that the Reſolution of our Faith is only with ſafety to be made into the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity and Infallibility of the Roman Church alone by it ſelf, or its Dependants, we are yet to ſeek: And
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:104627:73"/>much wonder that the Ancients in all their Diſputes with <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> ſhould take ſo great a compaſs to confute their Adverſaries from <hi>Scripture, Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>other Authorities</hi> beſide what the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> afforded; and not, with our modern Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, make ſhort work in appealing to this laſt only effectual way of Deciſion, had it then been received, and known for ſo fundamental a Principle of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity as is now pretended.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As this uninterrupted Succeſſion of Biſhops, where yielded, is no ſufficient Proof of the Truth of the Doctrine of any Church; ſo neither is it <hi>a warrantable Ground of the claim of Superiority over another Church,</hi> which hath not ſo clear evidences thereof. And if theſe two fail thoſe we have to deal with, they will gain very little by this <hi>Note.</hi> For as the Succeſſion may, yea ought to be ſuppoſed good, when ſufficient Proof appears not to the contrary: So where there really appears Want of this Succeſſion, and need to to fly to other Churches for the Relief thereof, yet this charitable Aſſiſtance which all ought moſt freely and willingly to offer, or lend to each other, does not preſently give one the Power over the other for ever after. The Apoſtles themſelves ſeem not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their Power over the Churches by them planted ſo much from the Succeſs of their Labours, as from their immediate Divine Commiſſion, intimated in the Beginning of their Epiſtles, though the one was a great Endearment and Enforcement to the others, and ſo it ought to be. We may ſuppoſe ſometimes greater Churches converted by the Miniſtry of the leſs, who were ſo happy as to receive the Faith before them. Younger Churches have many times leapt over the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:104627:74"/>Heads of much Elder, and the Inferior having gained ſome conſiderable Advancement in a Civil Account, have ſoon arrived at a proportionable Promotion in the Eccleſiaſtical, as particularly the Church of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople.</hi> And ſomewhat like may be obſerved in the Changes of other Cities: Superior Biſhops are ordained by thoſe, over whom they after have ſome Authority. For if not only Priority of Order, but alſo Superiority of Juriſdiction be unalterably entai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon the Eldeſt; I doubt the Church of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> which was certainly the <hi>Mother-Church,</hi> muſt be alſo the <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> of all. And if that Line be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, I believe there are many other Branches it muſt deſcend to before it come to the <hi>Roman.</hi> Some have diſputed whether <hi>Britain</hi> it ſelf had not a Church as ſoon. And that they ſhould ground a claim from what they will not yield to others ſufficient for the ſame purpoſe, ſeems very unequal.</p>
                     <p>But ſurely the Deſigns and Effects of this Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Warfare, are not like thoſe uſually of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, meerly to inlarge the Dominions of their Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and advance the Power of their Governors. The Churches conqueſts conſiſt in the multitude of Souls gained to Chriſt; in the new Plantations, or farther Growth and Emprovements of all Chriſtian Graces, and Vertues in Mens Winds; in faſtning ſome Good and Benefit on them, and not in gaining new outward De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendances to our ſelves, any farther than the needful Preſervation of Peace, and Order, in every diſtinct Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion. What is more ſmells too ſtrong of Worldly Policy, Temporal Gain, or Secular Ambition to have any true Place here. When Men are more induſtrious to promote and encourage every where ſincere Piety,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:104627:74"/>and Probity, and leſs concern'd in the claims of unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Soveraignty and Power, then may we think true Religion, and not other Intereſt, to be the firſt Mover with them.</p>
                     <p>But to conſider a little, the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s Teſtimonies here. The <hi>Second</hi> out of St. <hi>Auguſtin, Pſalmo contra partem Donati,</hi> being the fulleſt and alone pertinent to their purpoſe, I ſingle out. <q>
                           <hi>Numerate, inquit, Sacerdotes, vel ab ipſa Sede</hi> Petri, <hi>&amp; in ordine illa Patrum, quis cui ſucceſſerit, videte; Ipſa eſt Petriae quam non vincunt Superbae Inferorum Portae.</hi>
                        </q> As to the latter part of it where the ſtreſs lies, we have this Argument that it muſt be interpreted only as an occaſional Alluſion, that in many places where he purpoſely expounds that Paſſage of the Goſpel, he makes Chriſt himſelf, confeſſed by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to be the Rock on which he built his Church; as <hi>Retract. l.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 30. and in <hi>cap.</hi> 21. Sti. <hi>Johan. Tom.</hi> 9. <hi>p.</hi> 572. <hi>Super hanc Petram quam confeſſus ſe,</hi> &amp;c. And indeed aſſerts no more but matter of Fact in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle caſe, that the Seat of St. <hi>Peter</hi> (to which the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> when condemned by the <hi>African</hi> Biſhops upon their Appeal to the <hi>Emperour</hi> were referred) was as <hi>a Rock,</hi> which the proud Gates of Hell (ſo he reſembles their Preſumptions) doe not prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt: That is, the cauſe was given againſt them by the <hi>Roman Biſhop,</hi> and others joyn'd with him. Where though ſome Alluſion may be made to the Place in the Goſpel; yet it is not fair to ſtrain an Argument thence againſt the plain and expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned Expoſition of if; eſpecially among ſuch ſhort Strictures, of which that Tract is made up. And for the other Teſtimonies in <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian,</hi> and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:104627:75"/>
                        <hi>Epiphanius;</hi> We acknowledg their Arguments good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt upſtart Teachers of new Doctrine. But they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly joyn <hi>Succeſſion of Doctrine with that of Perſons,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it had been of no Validity, unleſs by referring their Adverſaries (who were not much moved by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority) to the evidences of the conveyance of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Opinions to them from the firſt Originals. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two places in St. <hi>Aug.</hi> and that of <hi>Optatus</hi> againſt the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> imply no more to thoſe preſumptuous Incloſers of the whole Church within their own narrow Bounds, and Beginners of it from themſelves, than a Challenge for them to ſhew any thing of the Apoſtolical Original thereof, or after-conveyance like other Churches, and particularly the <hi>Roman</hi> wherein St. <hi>Auguſtin Epiſt.</hi> 165, after a Catalogue of the Biſhops thereof, thus cloſes, <hi>In hoc ordine ſucceſſionis nullus Donatiſta Epiſcopus invenitur:</hi> And in all his Diſputes with them lays the charge of the Guilt of their Schiſm upon the ſeparation from all the Churches, diſperſed over the World, according to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical and Evangelical Declarations. No Perſon or Place to prejudicate to all others, it follows in the fore-mentioned, <hi>ut certa ſit ſpes fidelibus quae non in Homine ſed in Domino collocata.</hi> All which and more, to any that conſult the References throughout, rather confirm our Claim. We have as good Evidences and Conveyances as our Adverſaries can challenge, we pretend not to any new Doctrine: But for the main ours are what them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves dare not but own. What we reject among them are not only as Additions, which none muſt make to the firſt Principles of Religion, but over and above very dangerous and deſtructive to the common Faith of both. For the Proof of ſuch Doctrines, or continuance of it, we need no new Miracles, or new Authority from Heaven,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:104627:75"/>but an orderly conveyance of the old, and that we ſtill, Thanks be to God, retain.</p>
                     <p>And truly <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Inference from the mentioned Citations will carry in it little or no force, but ſeems rather to incline the contrary way. If they, ſays he, made ſo much of the continued Succeſſion of 12, 20, or 40 Biſhops, how much may we of more than 200? Certainly the Argument from Succeſſion here is much ſtronger the nearer it comes to the Original, from which all the Authority, and Virtue in the following are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived; the Water may be ſuppoſed clearer, and more natural the nearer to the Fountain-Head. There is at leaſt ſome danger from every Remove or Change made. I am apt to think they themſelves will hardly ſuppoſe they have a better Argument from Succeſſion, than thoſe had 1200, or more Years ſince. For if it be good now, be ſure it was ſo then. But it will not follow alternately, if then good, it muſt hold ſo ſtill. The Caſe may be preſum'd much different in the Succeſſion of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Dignities, and Secular; in this latter it may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the Title gathers ſtill more ſtrength by the length of its Continuance, is more confirm'd by long Poſſeſſion, &amp; many ſuper induct Obligations, but was, it may be, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in its Beginnings, as in moſt particular Governments, now, when of a meer Human Original, ſo far as we may with due Modeſty and Reverence look that way. But Spiritual Power in whomſoever, where Legitimate, can only deſcend at firſt from an immediate Divine Commiſſion, and that we may ſuppoſe gains nothing by paſſing through Human Hands, and Infirmities, being moſt ſtrong and powerful in its firſt riſe. Indeed did the <hi>Cardinal</hi> only argue for a Temporal and Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Monarchy, and would he be content to begin it after
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:104627:76"/>
                        <hi>Pope Gregory the Firſt,</hi> and then to riſe by degrees for a while: Succeſſion appears to me the beſt Argument they have.</p>
                     <p>However it is much eaſier to ſhew fair Evidences of the unaltered conveyance of the ſame Truth from one to another, when it hath gone through ſo few Hands, and that the eldeſt bears its Date, but a very few Centuries of (as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> expreſly in the place cited, <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3. and <hi>Epiphanius Hom.</hi> 27. <hi>Carpocrat. p.</hi> 104.) than it can be when they are multiplied to the preſent number, and the Foot-ſteps of its continued Paſſage are almoſt worn out through ſo long a tract of Time, and numerous croſs Accidents.</p>
                     <p>Yet, to give them their due, the eminent Zeal of ſeveral of their firſt Biſhops, that Sealed to the Cuſtody of the true Faith with their Blood, being ſtill as it were in view of their Perſecutors; their general Conſtancy thereto, in which ſo many wavered or fell in the time of the <hi>Arian</hi> Perſecution; the Relief, and Refuge they then, and after, afforded to ſuch as ſuffered in that, or like Cauſes; as well as the Prerogative of their Place in the <hi>Imperial City,</hi> and the current Tradition of their Churches firſt Foundation, by the joint Labours of thoſe chief Apoſtles St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> theſe gave them great credit in thoſe Ages; and while they uſed their Power ſo well, every one was ready to enlarge it, and to flee thither for Sanctuary when oppreſs'd. In which caſe Men are very apt to ſpeak bountifully of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons. And no marvel, if they ſingle out ſometimes ſo venerable a Name and Authority to oppoſe, and even to bear down the impertinent Obſtinacy, and peeviſh Preſumption of every new upſtart Schiſmatick or Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, that would dictate to us ſtrange and unheard-of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:104627:76"/>Principles, and unchurch all before, or beſide themſelves, and muſt begin the Date of it from themſelves: For thus moſt of the Citations mention'd are plainly levell'd. And in ſuch a Caſe we ſhould judg the arguing ſufficient ſtill to ſilence ſuch an inſolent Boaſter, though we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the Succeſſion no ſooner than the time they ended, and when we own Religion began to decline in ſome parts, but ſure not to expire. Nay I could add, though we ſhould riſe no higher than the Reformation it ſelf, as late as it was; and how contemptuouſly ſoever they are pleaſed ſometimes to ſpeak of the happy Inſtruments thereof.</p>
                     <p>An extraordinary Providence alſo ſeems to have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Preſervation of them ſo long under the <hi>Arian Gothick Kings,</hi> and a ſtrange temporal Felicity in being ſtill Gainers in the end by all the Invaſions and Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties incident to ſo many Changes of Government, by which moſt beſide were Loſers. But I ſhould think if they conſulted <hi>Scripture, Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Examples with preſent ſenſible Obſervation, more than any fancied Schemes and Models of their own, what they would judg beſt to have done: They might think it not unlikely, at leaſt be more willing to ſtand to the tryal whether it be not ſo, that upon ſo long a continued and ſtill growing acceſſion of Wealth and Greatneſs to their Church, many and great Corruptions might creep in: which we charge them with, and have only removed by the Reformation, without turning them or our Anceſtors out of the Church before, or our ſelves ſince.</p>
                     <p>If the Favours they have ſo long enjoyed make them more induſtrious and cautious in the Examination of themſelves to reform whatever they can find amiſs, and to be more charitably helpful, and beneficial to others,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:104627:77"/>they will be far better employed than in graſping at ſtill more Power, and juſtifying all that they teach, or do, by the (oft to us) unaccountable Succeſſes of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; which the worſt Cauſes have fled to for ſhelter, and the worſt Men, when they had nothing elſe to plead.</p>
                     <p>God Almighty give us all Grace entirely to devote all our Studies and Labours to the Service of our Great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and the beſt, and moſt certain Benefit of his Church, in the Furtherance of Sound Faith, and Univerſal Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Life, in all true Piety, Probity, Charity, and Peaceable Communion among all that in every place call on the Name of the Lord, theirs and ours: Which will afford us a far more comfortable Reckoning at the great Day of Account, than to buſie our ſelves in thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all beſide out of the Church here, and pronouncing Condemnation againſt them for hereafter; or, on the other ſide, in carrying on ſtill unaccountable Prejudices, and endleſs Separations. The God of Wiſdom, Truth, and Peace will (I hope) at length give us a right Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in all Things.</p>

                     <p>VVEE are very willing to own this for a true <hi>Mark</hi> of the Church, <hi>its Agreeing with the Doctrine of the Primitive Church;</hi> and we are ſo far from <hi>confuting Bellarmin</hi> for his giving of it, that we do not doubt but he has hereby <hi>confuted</hi> himſelf and the whole <hi>Cauſe</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church:</hi> for if we may be allowed to go back to the Primitive Church, and to examine the Doctrine and Belief of <hi>that</hi> in order to find out what is the true Church at preſent, then the pretended Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the preſent Church, and the Neceſſity of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and believing all that ſhe impoſes, muſt be <hi>ſet by,</hi> till it appears that ſhe requires the ſame Doctrine, and no other, than what was taught and believed by the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church: For according to this <hi>Note</hi> it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear which is the true Church, till it firſt appears that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:104627:78"/>it agrees with the Doctrine of the Primitive; and till it appears that it is a true Church, it cannot ſure appear to be an Infallible one: for it cannot he pretended that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility belongs to any but the true Church, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be firſt known that the preſent Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with the Primitive, before it can be known that ſhe is an Infallible Guide or Teacher: So that we mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly gain this firſt by this <hi>Note</hi> of the Church, that all thoſe big and bluſtering Claims to Infallibility muſt be poſtpon'd and laid aſide, till that of agreeing with the Doctrine of the Primitive Church be made out, and when that is done we ſhall not have quite ſo much reaſon to queſtion her Infallibility. We deſire nothing more than to have the matter brought to this Iſſue, Whether the Doctrines of the <hi>Reformed</hi> or the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree beſt with the Primitive? Since for Reaſons well known to themſelves, and very much ſuſpected by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they are ſo willing to <hi>goe off</hi> from <hi>Scripture,</hi> and to decline the Judgment of <hi>that</hi> as incompetent and inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in moſt of the Controverſies between us, we are very ready to leave them to be decided by any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different <hi>Arbitrator;</hi> for we think it is a little odd and unreaſonable they ſhould make themſelves the <hi>only Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> of what is in difference between us; and therefore we are very ready to ſtand to the <hi>Award</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mpirage</hi> of the Primitive Church, and we are not in the leaſt afraid to venture our whole Cauſe to the ſentence and deciſion of <hi>That:</hi> for tho the <hi>Scripture</hi> be our <hi>only Rule</hi> of Faith and Doctrine neceſſary to be believed by us, becauſe we know of no other <hi>Revelation</hi> but <hi>that,</hi> and nothing but <hi>Revelation</hi> makes any Doctrine <hi>neceſſary</hi> to be believed; yet we are very willing to take the ſence and meaning of <hi>Scripture</hi> both from <hi>it ſelf,</hi> and from the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> too: ſo according to <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis, to have
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:104627:78"/>the line of Scriptural Interpretation be directed by the Rule of Eccleſiaſtical and Catholick Judgment;</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>We deſire nothing more than to find out the true <hi>Church</hi> by the <hi>true Faith,</hi> and we think this is the true <hi>way</hi> to find it out: For Chriſtian Faith is <hi>prior</hi> and antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Chriſtian Church; and <hi>that</hi> muſt be firſt known and ſuppoſed, before we can know any ſuch thing as a Church; for 'tis the <hi>Faith</hi> makes the <hi>Church,</hi> and not the <hi>Church</hi> the <hi>Faith:</hi> and therefore the <hi>true Church</hi> is to be known by the <hi>true Doctrine,</hi> and not the <hi>true Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> by the <hi>Church,</hi> as is ſome Folks way.</p>
                     <p>If a <hi>Church</hi> then has never ſo many other glorious <hi>Marks,</hi> yet if it has not the <hi>true Faith,</hi> according to the Rule before laid down, it cannot be the true <hi>Church;</hi> and if it have never ſo true a <hi>Succeſſion</hi> of Paſtors deriving their Power in an uninterrupted Line from the Apoſtles, yet if it have not a true <hi>Succeſſion</hi> of Doctrine too from them, it is not a true Church: So far indeed as it holds and profeſſes the common Chriſtian Faith, ſo far, for that very Reaſon, it is a true Church; and ſo far we allow the <hi>Roman</hi> to be a true Church; and ſo far they cannot deny us to be one neither, as the ſame Faith &amp; Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of Chriſtianity are received and believed by <hi>both of us:</hi> for this Faith being the ſame to <hi>both of us,</hi> makes <hi>us both</hi> ſo far to be true Churches upon the <hi>ſame grounds;</hi> but ſo far as we differ in Matters of Faith, whether we
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:104627:79"/>or they be the true Church, is the queſtion between us, and we are willing to have this determined by the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church: If the Faith then and Doctrine of the Roman Church, wherein it differs from us, be the ſame with the Faith and Doctrine of the Primitive Church; then that is the true Church: If it be contrary, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to the Faith and Doctrine of the Primitive, then it is not the true Church, but a <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>erroneous one.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And here we ought to make a <hi>particular</hi> enquiry and examination of all thoſe Matters of Faith which are in controverſie between us, and bring each of them to the <hi>Teſt</hi> and <hi>Trial,</hi> and ſee which Church does moſt agree in all thoſe <hi>diſputed</hi> Doctrines with the Doctrine of the Primitive Church; for here we muſt be allowed to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine <hi>particular</hi> Doctrines that are in difference between us; and every <hi>private Chriſtian</hi> who is ſeeking for the true Church, muſt, if he would find it by this Mark of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> be allowed to inquire into and examine the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the preſent Church, and ſee whether they are agreeable to thoſe of the Primitive or no; and this he muſt do by his private Judgment, and by the beſt means and helps he can uſe to this purpoſe: for he is not yet ſuppoſed to have <hi>found out</hi> the true Church, but to be <hi>finding it out</hi> by this <hi>Mark</hi> given of it; and till he has found it out by this <hi>Mark</hi> and Direction, he cannot be under its guidance and conduct, ſo that he muſt make uſe of his own Reaſon and Judgment at leaſt till he has thus found it; that is, he muſt have the Liberty to ſearch and inquire into the Faith and Doctrines of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, and to judg for himſelf as well as he can by his own beſt Diſcretion, and the beſt helps he can uſe, which Church does beſt agree in its Faith and Doctrines with the Primitive; and according as he ſhall upon his
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:104627:79"/>own enquiry and examination find, ſo he muſt chooſe <hi>that</hi> Church which he thinks is the <hi>trueſt;</hi> but he muſt not give himſelf up to the abſolute guidance and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any Church, at leaſt till he has by this way found out the true; which is another manifeſt <hi>Advantage</hi> that we have by this Note againſt our Adverſaries, who are rather for bearing Men down with the bold pretence of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and the terrible fright of Damnation out of the true Church, rather than ſuffering them according to this true <hi>Method</hi> to find it out.</p>
                     <p>And as he muſt thus uſe his own Judgment in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial ſearch into the Doctrines of the Primitive Church, which will have as many Inconveniences in it, I fear, as they are apt to object againſt ſearching, to this end, into the Scriptures; ſo he muſt examine all the <hi>particular</hi> Doctrines that are controverted between <hi>both</hi> Churches, to ſee which are moſt agreeable to the Faith of the Primitive; for he cannot know this in the <hi>Lump</hi> and by the <hi>Groſs;</hi> and to tell him, as they ſometimes do, that 'tis impoſſible for their Church to have departed from the Faith of the Primitive, and that the preſent Age could not alter from the Doctrine of the foregoing, and ſo upward; this is not to make the Primitive Faith a <hi>Note</hi> of the preſent Church, but to <hi>prevent</hi> all enquiry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this <hi>Note,</hi> and to make it wholly uſeleſs and inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant.</p>
                     <p>He that will therefore make uſe of this <hi>Mark</hi> to know the true Church by, muſt be ſuppoſed and allowed to inquire into the Doctrine of the Primitive Church about all thoſe particular Controverſies and Matters of Faith that are in difference between us, and muſt not have his Enquiry <hi>ſtopt</hi> and <hi>precluded</hi> by any general Pretences of the Infallibility either of <hi>Oral Tradition,</hi> or of the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Church,</hi> but muſt freely and impartially examin the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:104627:80"/>particular Doctrines that are controverted, that ſo he may bring every one of them to the <hi>Touchſtone</hi> of the Primitive Faith, and try whether they are agreable to the ſame or no; and according as he finds this; that is, whatſoever Church he finds to hold the ſame <hi>Doctrine</hi> with the Primitive in all the particular Points of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, <hi>That</hi> he muſt conclude to be the true Church from this <hi>Note</hi> given of it.</p>
                     <p>Our Adverſaries do not uſually care to enter into par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Points of Controverſy, wherein they are very ſenſible they ſhall be ſooner foiled and bafled; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they generally wave <hi>thoſe</hi> which are capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made more plain and evident to moſt Mens Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities; and they chuſe rather to diſpute and wrangle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout more general and intricate Matters, in which there is ſome more room to cavil, and to amuſe and perplex themſelves and others with ſeeming Difficulties; ſo that tho particular Controverſies may be made very plain, and it appears often in them as clear almoſt as the Light, on which ſide the Truth is; as, Whether Prayers ought to be in a known Tongue? Whether the Communion ought to be in both kinds? Whether the Scriptures are to be read by the People? and the like; yet to avoid thoſe, and to prevent the Diſadvantage of ſuch manifeſt and particular Points, they carry the Diſpute off to other things, and run into the general Controversies of <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility</hi> and <hi>Church-Authority,</hi> and <hi>Reſolution of Faith,</hi> and a <hi>Judg in Controverſies,</hi> and the like; and here they think there is more room for Cavil and Sophiſtry, and they can hereby lead Men if not into <hi>Scepticiſm</hi> and <hi>Doubtfulneſs,</hi> yet into a <hi>Maze</hi> and <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> where they ſhall not ſo eaſily <hi>get out:</hi> Which <hi>way</hi> of theirs ſeems to me, juſt as if a Perſon in a plain Controverſy about Weight or Meaſure which were otherwiſe eaſy to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:104627:80"/>ſhould, to avoid <hi>that,</hi> think fit to run into the perplext Diſpute, What was the true Standard of Weights and Meaſures? or everlaſtingly wrangle about that Queſtion, Whether Matter conſiſted of Diviſible or Indiviſible Parts? and becauſe he could raiſe Difficulties here, and keep up a long and intricate Controverſy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thoſe Matters, would not be brought to yield, that a Pound was heavier than an Ounce, or an Ell lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than an Inch. I cannot but think that ſome of our particular Controverſies may be almoſt as clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided as thoſe two; and that the running into ſome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ones, is as remote and ſophiſtical as the other.</p>
                     <p>We muſt therefore, according to this <hi>Note</hi> of the Church, not be <hi>foreprized</hi> or <hi>prevented</hi> with any ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and more perplext Diſpute, but we muſt fairly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine all the particular Doctrines of the Church, and ſee whether they are agreeable with thoſe of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church or no, before we can find out the true Church at preſent; not that the true Church we are to look for, is confined to any particular Place or Country, but like a great <hi>Homogenial</hi> Body, every Part of which is of the fame nature with the Whole; wherever the true Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Faith is profeſt in all the Parts of it, there is a True Church; and all particular Churches being united together in the ſame Bond of Faith, do make up the Catholick Church over all the World. If there were but one Particular Church upon the whole Earth, that did profeſs this True Faith, <hi>that</hi> alone might be called the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> becauſe that alone had that Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith, which did properly make and conſtitute the True Church: But this Faith being common to a great many Particular Churches, this makes them to be all true, and all Catholick, as to Faith; but as to Place, 'tis ridiculous to call any one <hi>Catholick,</hi> and as abſurd
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:104627:81"/>as to call a Part the Whole; in that ſenſe no Church is Catholick, in the other every Church is that holds the <hi>Whole</hi> Chriſtian Faith: We are not therefore to ſeek for any Particular Church, that ſhall uſurp to it ſelf the Name of <hi>Catholick,</hi> in excluſion to all others; but for any Church that maintains the true Catholick Faith profeſt by the Primitive, which upon that account is a True Church, and acknowledged ſo by this Mark which is here given of it.</p>
                     <p>To find out ſuch a one, and to diſtinguiſh it from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, we muſt very carefully enquire into all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Doctrines and Points of Faith which are held by it, and ſee whether they are agreeable to the Faith and Doctrine of the Primitive Church; and according to this Method, and ſaving to our ſelves all the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Advantages of it, we are very willing to have the Difference adjuſted between us and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to have it decided by this <hi>Note,</hi> whether we or they are the True Church; that is, whether we or they, in all Matters of Controverſy between us, do moſt agree with the Doctrine of the Primitive Church.</p>
                     <p>And here is a very large <hi>ſcope</hi> offered to me, and what has taken up a great many <hi>Volumes</hi> on both ſides; ſo that to moſt People <hi>Scripture,</hi> one would think, ſhould be a ſhorter and an eaſier, and therefore a better way to know the True Church by; but ſince our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries are not willing to leave the Caſe to that, we are ready to accept of the Primitive Church to be Judg between us; and, as has been often offered before by Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> and others, we ſhall be very willing to ſtand to <hi>its</hi> award and deciſion: for however ſome few Divines of the Reformation, before they were ſo well acquainted with Antiquity, and when they could not ſo well diſtinguiſh what was genuine, from what was
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:104627:81"/>ſpurious and corrupted by your Church, were at firſt eſpecially more jealous and diſtruſtful than they need to have been of it, and unwilling to venture their Cauſe to any other Sentence but that of Scripture, which had ſo plainly decided for them, and was indeed the moſt proper to be appealed to; yet the greateſt number, and the moſt learned of the Proteſtant Writers, have never declined the Judgment of the Primitive Church, but next to the inſpired Writings of the Apoſtles, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways eſteemed and been willing to be determined by it: And we are well aſſured, that the Ancient Church, even the <hi>Roman</hi> it ſelf, as well as the whole Chriſtian beſides, is in all material Points on the Proteſtant ſide; and a perfect Stranger, if not an utter Enemy to thoſe new Articles of Faith, and Corruptions of Doctrine, which have been ſince brought into the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Church, and which we have for that Reaſon <hi>proteſted</hi> againſt, becauſe they were unknown and contrary to the Faith and Doctrine of the Primitive Church.</p>
                     <p>It would too much exceed the ſet Limits of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, to make this out ſo fully as might eaſily be done, by going through the chiefeſt Points of Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us; <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his Diſcourſe upon this <hi>Note,</hi> goes wholly <hi>off</hi> from it, and chuſes rather to purſue <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and ſome other worthy <hi>Reformers,</hi> through all the Paths of Calumny and Slander; but I ſhall not follow him, to take him off from thoſe falſe and injurious Repreſentations he hath made of their Doctrines: If any Body has the curioſity to ſee the Art of <hi>Miſrepreſenting</hi> in its greateſt perfection, let him but read that Chapter; but if he will ſee it as perfectly ſhamed and expoſed, let him read Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi>'s long and learned Anſwer to it<note n="*" place="margin">Apologia Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholica, <hi>p.</hi> 61. <hi>to p.</hi> 278.</note>.

                     <p>I confeſs it would be too <hi>prolix,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſays, to produce all the Teſtimonies of the Ancients, thereby to ſhew what was the Doctrine of the Primitive Church, in every particular Point controverted between us; I ſhall therefore offer only ſome plain and brief Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, by which the ſenſe of the Primitive Church may be undeniably known in moſt of the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and by which it will appear what was the Doctrine of the Church then, and how contrary that of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is now to it.</p>
                     <p>And here I ſhould firſt begin with the moſt Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that is, with the <hi>Apoſtolick Church,</hi> which truly and only deſerves the Title of being <hi>Mother and Miſtreſs</hi> of all Chriſtian Churches that ever were or ſhall be in the World; it is as vain as arrogant for any later and particular Church to aſſume <hi>that</hi> to it ſelf, which is but a <hi>Siſter</hi>-Church at moſt, and younger than ſome of the reſt; and tho more fine and proud, yet not half ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and uncorrupt. This <hi>Apoſtolick</hi> Church, which was founded and governed by the Apoſtles over all the World, is the true Standard of the Chriſtian Church; and as in revealed Religion, <hi>That which is firſt, is true,</hi>
                        <pb n="123" facs="tcp:104627:82"/>according to <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s<note n="*" place="margin">Id verum quod prius, id prius quod ab initio, ab ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio quod ab A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolis. <hi>Tertul. de praeſcript. l.</hi> 4.</note> Axiom, becauſe it comes nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to the firſt pure Fountain of Revelation; ſo as he adds, <hi>That is firſt which is from the Beginning, and from the Apoſtles.</hi> We ſhould firſt then examine what was the Faith and Doctrine of the <hi>Apoſtolick</hi> Church, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and almoſt only account of which we have in their own <hi>Canonical Writings,</hi> which are received and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſuch by the whole Chriſtian Church; and in theſe our Adverſaries find ſo little of their own late and new Doctrines, that they cannot but own that theſe are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to authoriſe and eſtabliſh moſt of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Authority of the preſent Church, and without the help of <hi>unwritten Traditions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When we produce Scripture againſt our Adverſaries, we then produce the only Authentick Records of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick Church, and the only certain account we have of the Faith and Doctrine of the moſt Primitive Church: let them object therefore never ſo much againſt Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as a <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> yet whilſt it contains the only ſure <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of what was taught and believed by the firſt Chriſtian Church, ſo far as any of theſe Doctrines are not in Scripture, ſo far they cannot appear to be the Doctrine of the <hi>Apoſtolick</hi> Church, and whilſt we hold all that Faith, and all thoſe Doctrines that are contained in Scripture, we hold all that can be <hi>known</hi> to be ſo in the moſt pure and moſt Primitive Church; and whatſoever they have added to Scripture, which they will needs have to be but an imperfect Rule of Faith, they have added, ſo far as can be known, to the Doctrine of the <hi>Apoſtolick</hi> Church: for if Scripture be not the only Rule of <hi>that,</hi> yet it is the only <hi>Hiſtorical Account</hi> we have of it. But I ſhall not at preſent deal with them out of Scripture, tho as it is only a Record and Evidence of the Apoſtolical Faith, they will count this but a Trick, I know, to draw
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:104627:83"/>them into a Scripture Diſpute, which they are mighty averſe to, and which they deſign to avoid by an Appeal from that to the Primitive Church; we will go on there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with our <hi>Note</hi> as they, I ſuppoſe, mean and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, and that we may not be too troubleſom to them with Scripture and the Apoſtolick Writings, we will go ſeveral Ages lower, even down to thoſe Times wherein the Church was in its glorious State under the firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Emperors, and whether <hi>their</hi> Doctrines or <hi>ours</hi> were moſt agreable to thoſe of this Primitive Church: Let us now come briefly to enquire in ſome particular Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and by ſome few ſhort Remarks and Obſervations.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, That it appears not by any Liturgy, or Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtick Form that was ever uſed by the Church, no not by the Roman Canon it ſelf, which is much ancienter than this Doctrine, and therefore not ſo conformed to it; That the Church ever uſed any <hi>Prayer</hi> to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe at the Euchariſt, that the Subſtance of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Elements ſhould be changed or done away, and the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt ſubſtituted inſtead of them, under the Species or Accidents, but only, that they might be made the Body and Blood of Chriſt by the Spirits coming down upon them, ſo that it was only a Spiritual and Sacramental, not a Subſtantial Change of them that was ever prayed for, or ever believed; for if the Church had always had this Faith, it would ſurely have ſometimes prayed in it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> I obſerve that in thoſe Times when this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine came firſt into the Church, which was a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Berengarius,</hi> it was ſo new and <hi>raw,</hi> that it was not fully digeſted, nor perfectly underſtood even by thoſe who then held it, as appears by that blundering Recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which was drawn up for him after the Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of no leſs than three Popes and five Synods, wherein he is made to ſay, That <hi>after Conſecration the true Body and Blood of Christ is not only Sacramentally but ſenſibly and truly handled and broke by the Hands of the Prieſts, and ground by the Teeth of the Faithful.</hi>

                     <p>If Tranſubſtantiation were then but <hi>new,</hi> thoſe other Doctrines which have <hi>iſſued</hi> from it, and are its proper <hi>Production,</hi> could not be <hi>old;</hi> ſuch as <hi>Adoration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, Communion in one kind, Solitary Maſſes, and the Proper and Propitiatory Sacrifice of the Maſs:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall not ſay any thing of them, ſince their Date will be owned to be as late as that of Tranſubſtantiation; and tho they may not follow from it, yet they cannot be maintained or believed without it; ſo that what has been ſaid againſt the one, takes away the very Foundation of the other.</p>

                     <p>As to <hi>Prayers in an unknown Tongue,</hi> this cannot I hope be ſaid to be the Practice of the Primitive Church, and if the Language of <hi>Rome</hi> had been as unalterable, as ſhe pretends her Faith is, her Prayers had been in a known Tongue now, but I doubt they are both equally changeable.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Worſhip of Saints and Angels,</hi> and the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up Prayers to them and to the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> I ſhall offer but one Obſervation out of Antiquity, which does for ever deſtroy all manner of Worſhip, of what degree ſoever, to any but the true God, and that is the Charge of Idolatry, which was laid by all the <hi>Orthodox</hi> Fathers, againſt the <hi>Arians,</hi> for worſhipping and praying to Chriſt, when they believed him not to be the true God, but only a Creature tho of the moſt exalted Nature: This does ſo fully ſhew the ſenſe of the Church againſt all Worſhip, be it of what kind it will, to any Creature; (for it was not the higheſt and moſt ſovereign Worſhip which the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> were ſuppoſed or charged to give to Chriſt) that it is the plaineſt thing in the World, that there could be no manner of Worſhip <hi>then</hi> to Saints or Angels or to the Bleſſed Virgin, as there is now in the Roman Church; But he that will ſee the cleareſt Account of Antiquity in this matter, let him conſult a moſt excellent Diſcourſe, <hi>concerning the Worſhip of the Bleſſed Virgin and the Saints, with an Account of the Beginnings and Riſe of it among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians againſt</hi> Monſieur de Meaux.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Worſhip of Images,</hi> it is too well known at what time and with what oppoſition that was brought into the Weſtern Church, and how great a Part of it
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:104627:86"/>did then declare againſt them; ſo that it was impoſſible <hi>that</hi> ſhould have been the Doctrine of the Primitive Church, which was with ſo great a ſtrugle and violence brought into the Roman, at the latter end of the 7th Century: As to the firſt Ages, it is plain from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and the Council of <hi>Eliberis,</hi> that they would not ſuffer Images and Pictures in their Churches, and at firſt hardly thought the very making of them to be lawful, as appears from <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I muſt not inſiſt on <hi>Particulars,</hi> I offer only ſome few undeniable Breviates of Antiquity, by which it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but evidently appear to any ingenuous Man, that theſe Doctrines of the Roman Church which diſtinguiſh it from the Reformed, were not the Doctrines of the Primitive Church, but are plainly and notoriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the beſt Antiquity: tho they are very apt to brag of <hi>that</hi> upon all occaſions, yet how little they eſteem it, and how conſcious they are to themſelves that it is not for their purpoſe, and that it is truly againſt them, I ſhall by ſome general Remarks unqueſtionably demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and make them, if they have any ſhame, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it themſelves. And</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> What mean their <hi>Expurgatory Indices,</hi> whereby they have corrected ſo many Fathers, and blotted out and expunged ſo many Sentences out of the Writings of the moſt antient Doctors of the Church, and by new Additions, made them ſpeak contrary to themſelves in ſo many places of their Works, if they were not ſenſible that thoſe ancient Authors, who bring down to us the Doctrine of the Primitive Church, were in many things Witneſſes againſt them, and bore evident Teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their new Opinions? This is ſo plain a Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that Antiquity is againſt them, and renders them ſo much ſelf-condemned, that they intended to have kept
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:104627:86"/>theſe <hi>Indices</hi> very private, and it was only by chance that we came to the firſt knowledg of them. Our Learned <hi>James</hi> has acquainted the World with the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery</hi> of them, as he calls it, but it is ſo plain a Myſtery of Iniquity that it needs nothing to diſcover the Fraud and Villany of it. To raze ancient Records is a Crime of the higheſt nature; and they who are guilty of it, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is in the greateſt degree, by thus purging and correcting the Fathers, by an Inquiſition the moſt cruel of any other, and that appointed by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> need no other proof to convict them that that Cauſe which ſtands in need of ſuch Arts, is not to be defended without them; and this is ſuch a Note of a Church, that it brands and ſtigmatizes it with another Mark than that of Antiquity.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Beſides the correcting, or rather corrupting ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Fathers which were genuine Monuments of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, the counterfeiting ſo many falſe ones, and obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſo many ſpurious Authors upon the World, is a plain Evidence of the want of true Antiquity. This is like ſuborning of Witneſſes, which is enough to make all the World ſuſpect that what they are brought for, and what they depoſe, is not true; it is no other than forging of old Writings and Inſtruments to help out the known Weakneſs of a crackt Title. Thus the <hi>Decretal Epiſtles</hi> were counterfeited, to prop up the Pope's Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Power, and <hi>Conſtatine's Donation</hi> to eſtabliſh his Temporal. The Cheat of the firſt was ſo evident from the Style, being ſo ſordid and ſo unlike thoſe Ages, and yet being ſo like it ſelf in all parts, as ſhew'd it to have throughout but one Author, that tho they were formerly made uſe of, and did great Service, yet they are now laid by as too groſs to be owned by moſt of the Learned Men of that Church; and the other, tho it be
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:104627:87"/>ſtill defended by ſome of them, yet has ſuch marks of Forgery as makes moſt of them confeſs it; but great numbers are there of forged and ſpurious Authors, whole Teſtimonies are ſtill produced by theſe Writers for thoſe Doctrines and Opinions which are deſtitute of true Antiquity, a Collection of which is given us by our <hi>James</hi> in his <hi>Baſtardy of the falſe Fathers,</hi> and all thoſe Criticks who have wrote Cenſures upon the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Works cannot but own it. I cannot charge this upon any publick Act of the Church, as that of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and correcting the Fathers, but moſt of their Writers who bring ſuch large and falſe Muſters of the Fathers are guilty of it, and particularly ſome of their late Books amongſt us.<note n="*" place="margin">Conſenſus Veterum Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes Teſtium.</note> We have a very great and early Inſtance of this notorious way of Forgery in the very Head and Governours of that Church, and that was in falſifying the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canons, and thruſting in a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of a particular Synod among thoſe of a General Council, thereby to claim a Power of <hi>Appeals</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which was ſuch an Impoſture as ſhows what ſome Men will do to gain Power and Authority over other Churches, and what an unfaithful Preſerver a Church may be, that pretends to be infallible, not only of Oral Tradition, but even of Writings too, for they had Copies without queſtion of the Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> and if the other great Churches of <hi>Conſtantinople, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,</hi> and <hi>Alexandria</hi> had not had authentick and agreeing Copies to the contrary, the Churches of <hi>Africa</hi> had been run down by one of the moſt palpable Forgeries in the World, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would no doubt have made a great deal more uſe of it afterwards than upon that particular occaſion.

                     <p n="4">4. The Determinations and Decrees of the preſent Church are the only things they ſtick to, and 'tis the Authority and Infallibility of that which they relie more upon, and a thouſand times more regard than all Antiquity, or the whole Senſe of the Primitive Church. They pretend indeed not to determine any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary either to Scripture, or to the Primitive Church, but they make themſelves the only Judges of both; they tells us they make no new Doctrines, nor no Innovations in Faith, but they keep to themſelves the Power of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring what Doctrines are new, and what are not; and then I can ſee little difference between their <hi>making,</hi> and their <hi>declaring</hi> new Articles of Faith, ſince 'tis their declaring makes them to be believed and received as <hi>ſuch,</hi> when they were not to be ſo before: and how then does that differ from <hi>making</hi> them Articles of Faith? <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſpeaks plainly out, tho againſt his own Note, when he ſays, <hi>The Church of latter time hath Power not only to explain and declare, but conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:104627:88"/>and command thoſe things which belong to Faith</hi>
                        <note n="†" place="margin">Tract. de poteſt. Sum. Pontif.</note>. If the preſent Church has a Power to make more Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Articles, be believed as neceſſary to Salvation than were believed by the Primitive Church; then it may make Additions to the Chriſtian Faith, and make that neceſſary to be believed at one time, which was not at another: if it has not this Power, let them declare it, and not count others Hereticks who receive all the ancient Creeds, and hold the Faith of all the ancient Councils, and believe all thoſe Doctrines that the whole Primitive Church, in all Places, and at all times, ever held. Here with <hi>Lyrinenſis,</hi> we fix and ſet our Feet, and here we reſolve to ſtand and keep our Ground, and not be moved with every Wind of Doctrine that ſhall blow out of a new Quarter, and that a ſmall part of the preſent Church ſhall declare to be an Article of Faith, when It was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo declared by the Primitive. To ſay that they have made no new Articles of Faith in their Church, but only the ſame Articles made <hi>Explicit,</hi> which were <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit</hi> before in the Primitive Church, is as if they ſhould ſay, there are no new Men in the World ſince <hi>Adam</hi> or <hi>Noah,</hi> but only the ſame Men that were before Implicit in their Loyns, are now explicitly born into the World. Thus the Church, tho it be never ſo fruitful in produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Doctrines and Articles of Faith that never were before in the Church, yet makes nothing new; and however ſpurious its Doctrines may be, and however de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating from the Faith of our Forefathers, yet it muſt be ſaid to be of the ſame Kind and Species. Faith, it ſeems, in the Primitive Church, was but an Embrio, or like a ſmall Seed or Kernel, implicitly containing all the Parts entire, but in little; but when it is grown up and enlarged by the explicit Declaration of the Church, then it may ſwell into a mighty bigneſs, and increaſe
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:104627:89"/>even into the largeſt <hi>Tridentine</hi> Bulk, and be it never ſo unlike the former, yet it muſt be called the ſame ſtill. But if this implicit Faith was ſufficient for the Primitive Church, why may it not be ſo for the preſent, and what need have we of a more explicit Faith to ſave us now, than they had to ſave them then? All the eſſential Articles of Chriſtian Faith are to be explicitly believed at all times, and 'tis ſtrange that we muſt be now obliged to a more <hi>explicit</hi> Faith, and a more <hi>implicit</hi> Obedience than the Primitive Church was ever acquainted with: But after all, I hope thoſe Doctrines that are <hi>contrary</hi> to the Doctrines of the Primitive Church, were not then implicitly believed by it; and if they were not, I am ſure moſt of the Doctrines of the Roman Church, as different from the Reformed, were not her implicit Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines: but unleſs Error may be folded up with Truth, and one part of a Contradiction may be involved in the other, the late Corruptions and Decrees of the Roman Church, in her <hi>Trent</hi> Articles, were no way contained in the quite different Doctrines of the Primitive Church. And thus, becauſe I have gone too far with this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I muſt abruptly take leave of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and his Church, tho I reſolve, by God's Grace, to keep always to this his true Note of the Church, and therefore to that Church in which I am, which is the moſt agreeable to the Primitive of any in the World, both as to Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and every thing elſe.</p>

                     <p>THE Church as the Cardinal obſerves, is called in the Scriptures, <hi>one Body, one Spouſe, one Sheepfold:</hi> But he that infers from hence, that Unity is a proper Mark of the True Church, ought to be very well aſſured that the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Members</hi> are united no-where but in the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that the Harlot cannot be <hi>One</hi> as well as the Spouſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the World has hitherto been perſuaded that bare Unity is a Character to be found upon Societies of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Natures and contrary Deſigns; that of it ſelf it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers neither Good nor Evil, and may belong to a Body of Rebels, no leſs than to an Army of Loyal Subjects. Unity is then indeed a good Mark, when 'tis a Duty; as 'tis a Duty when the Terms of Union are ſo. For which Reaſon the Union of the Church is of all others
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:104627:90"/>the moſt excellent, becauſe all Men ought to follow that Truth and Goodneſs which are neceſſary to Salvation; and theſe are beſt preſerved and maintained by Union a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe who follow them: For which Reaſons alſo 'tis celebrated in the Goſpel with variety of Expreſſions. But to argue from hence that the Union of Members a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Themſelves, and with their Head, is a proper Note of the true Church, is juſt as if I ſhould conclude upon ſeeing a thouſand Men marching in good Order, and with equal Pace after their Leader, that therefore of neceſſity they muſt be going to <hi>York.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding therefore this Argument from <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> being attributed to the Church, the Cardinal did not think fit to leave his Mark ſo very looſe and common, but ſlips into the mention of thoſe things wherein the Unity of the Church conſiſts, as he pretends. He tells us, that the Head with which the Members are united is the <hi>Pope.</hi> And as for their Union among themſelves, he afterwards proves that all Catholicks muſt needs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in all Points of Faith, <hi>ſince they all ſubmit their own Senſe to the Senſe of one and the ſame chief Paſtor, guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church from the Chair of</hi> Peter, <hi>with the advice of other Paſtors.</hi> So that now we know what he means by the Union of the Members to their Head, and among themſelves; that is to ſay, the Union of the Members of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to the Pope as to their Head, and their Union among themſelves in believing all that he teaches from the Chair of St. <hi>Peter, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which Note does for its part make good what was obſerved at firſt, concerning the general Deſign of theſe <hi>Notes,</hi> which is not ſo much to deſcribe to us the proper Characters of a true Chriſtian Church, as to prove that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the only True Church. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Cardinal inſinuated at firſt, he ſeemed to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:104627:90"/>ſenſible, that the Union of the Members with the Head, and among themſelves, was too large a Note to fit no other Society but a true Chriſtian Church. Now if in reſtraining his Note he had underſtood <hi>Chriſt</hi> by the Head; and by the Union of the Members to one another, an Agreement in the Faith that was once delivered to the Saints; this indeed would have ſerved for the finding out of a True Church; but then this was too large for the Cardinal's Purpoſe, which was to find no other Church to be True but the <hi>Roman.</hi> And therefore by the <hi>Head</hi> it was neceſſary to underſtand the Pope, and by the Union of the Members, an Agreement in all that Doctrine which is taught by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. For it was to be hoped that this would mark all the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion <hi>in,</hi> but it would moſt undoubtedly mark all other Chriſtians <hi>out</hi> of the only true Church. For this is the admirable reaſoning to which it leads: That is the true Church which acknowledges the Pope for its Head, and for its Faith profeſſes the Doctrine, whatever it be, that is taught in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And from hence it muſt needs follow, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the only True Church. <hi>Quod erat demonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if the Cardinal had left the Matter thus in ſhorf, he had in my mind done better for his Church, and his reaſoning had been leſs exceptionable than he has made it in the purſuance of his Enlargements. When a Man has to do with an untractable piece of Matter, it often happens that the more he ſtrives to faſhion it to his own Purpoſe, the farther he is from it. And ſo this great Man by labouring over-much to make this his Mark of Unity utterly unſerviceable to any other Church, has given it that Figure at laſt, which makes it unfit for his own, as we ſhall ſee in convenient place.</p>
                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:104627:91"/>
                     <p>For I ſhall endeavour to make out theſe three things.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>I. That the Unity here offer'd is no true Note of the Church.</item>
                        <item>II. That if it were, yet the <hi>Roman</hi> Church has it not.</item>
                        <item>III. That that Unity which is indeed a Note of the Church we have, and that in a much greater degree than they.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>I. That <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity here offered is no true Note of the Church;</hi> which I ſhall ſhew concerning both his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of it.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>First, Concerning <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with the Pope as Head of the Church:</hi> That this ſhould be a Note of the Church, is a pretence that hath neither Scripture, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor Antiquity for it, but all againſt it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For <hi>Scripture;</hi> the Cardinal offers not any proof from thence of his Preſumption, which yet had been very requiſite to a point of ſo vaſt a Conſequence, if the Scripture had afforded any Teſtimony to his purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>That the Pope ſhould be the Head of the Church and the Center of its Unity, that Union to him ſhould be an eſſential Character of the Church, and the very Being of it depend upon him: But that the Scripture ſhould not give us the leaſt intimation of it, is a thing ſo perfectly unaccountable, that the very ſilence of the Scripture in a matter of this high nature, is to us a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Argument, that the Apoſtles knew nothing of any ſuch Conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>Eſpecially, ſince they did not forget to make plain and frequent mention of another Head of the Church, to which all the Members are to be united, <hi>viz.</hi> our
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:104627:91"/>Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> They tell us,<note place="margin">Eph. i. 20, 22, 23.</note> That <hi>when God rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him from the dead, he gave him to be HEAD over all things to the Church, which is HIS BODY.</hi> That <hi>as there are many Members in one Body, ſo we being many,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. xii. 4, 5.</note>

                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. xii. 12, 27.</note> i.e. <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the Church, the whole being denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from the Head, for we <hi>are the BODY OF CHRIST.</hi> We are told, That <hi>he is the Head,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. iv. 16.</note>

                        <hi>from whom the whole Body is fitly joyned together</hi> &amp;c. That he is <hi>the Head of the Church, and the Saviour of the Body:</hi> That he <hi>is the Head of the Body the Church.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Col. i. 18.</note> And much more to this purpoſe might be added. Now when the Church is ſo frequently declared to be one Body, and to this one Body, one Head is ſo frequently aſſigned and no more: What can any Man who is not poſſeſt with prejudice, make of this, but that there is no other Head of the Church beſides him who is ſo often mentioned as ſuch, and that by the ſame Reaſon that any Man goes about to add another Head to the Church, he might if he pleaſed find out another Church for the Head? Nor does it help at all that they pretend the Pope to be but the <hi>Vicarious</hi> and <hi>Miniſterial</hi> Head of the Church, ſince if without Union to him we are out of the Church, and have no part in Chriſt, it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that this pretended <hi>Vicarious</hi> Head ſhould have been as plainly and frequently expreſſed, as we know the True and Real Head to have been.</p>
                     <p>Nay, it was ſomething more neceſſary, ſince a very ſlender intimation might have been ſufficient to aſſure us that he who <hi>is the Image of the Inviſible God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Col. i. 15, 18.</note> 
                        <hi>by whom all things were created,</hi> and <hi>by whom all things conſiſt, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Head of the Body the Church:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ver. 14.</note> That he <hi>in whom we have redemption through his Blood,</hi> who is the <hi>Saviour of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:104627:92"/>the Body,</hi> and for our ſakes humbled himſelf to the Death of the Croſs, ſhould be alſo <hi>the Head of the Body,</hi> and be exalted to be <hi>Head</hi> over all things <hi>unto his Church;</hi> He I ſay in whom infinite Power and Goodneſs met. But that there ſhould be another Head given to the whole Church, to be united to which, was no leſs neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary than Union to <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf. And that this Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Head ſhould be no other than a ſinful Man, and he very often none of the beſt; this was ſo far removed from ſelf-Evidence or even Probability, that it certainly needed very expreſs mention, if not frequent inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now that he ſhould be frequently mentioned as Head of the Church, who in compariſon needed not to be mentioned at all; And that no mention at all ſhould be made of another Head of the Church that needs it very much, is for them to give an account of who make Union to this later Head no leſs neceſſary to a Part in the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> than Union to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
                     <p>Which account will be much harder to be given, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as there is no mention at all of this pretended Head, where there was the moſt fair and inviting occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for it, that can be well imagined. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhewing what Gifts <hi>Christ</hi> beſtowed upon his Church after his Aſcenſion, ſaith; <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. iv. 11, 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers</hi>—<hi>for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt</hi>— <hi>and that we might grow up into him in all things, which is the Head even Chriſt.</hi> Now here we do not only find our Saviour repreſented as the Head of his Church, and we as the Members of his Body, but that amongſt the ſeveral ſubordinate Members of which his Body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, there is no mention of that moſt neceſſary Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of all, (if I may call it a Member) the Vicarious
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:104627:92"/>Head of the Church. For it is not ſaid that he gave firſt <hi>Peter</hi> to be Head of his Church, and then Apoſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But he gave, firſt, ſome Apoſtles, and thoſe not as Heads of his Church neither, but as principal Members of it. And in the Beginning of the ſame Chapter, where he deſcribes the Unity of the Church, he ſays, there is <hi>one Body</hi> and <hi>one Spirit, one Hope of our Calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm, one God and Father of all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now I would fain know whether the Cardinal would have omitted here, <hi>one viſible Head of the Church, in which all ought to be united:</hi> And then let any Man tell me why St. <hi>Paul</hi> did. He had the like occaſion in another Place, where having ſaid much concerning the Unity of the Body of <hi>Chriſt; Ye are,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Body of Chriſt, and Members in particular; And God hath ſet ſome in the Church, firſt Apoſtles, ſecondly Prophets,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. xii. 27, 28.</note> 
                        <hi>thirdly Teachers</hi> &amp;c. Now I ſay, if this viſible Head of Unity had been elſewhere mentioned never ſo often, he ought not to have been omitted in any of theſe three places; much leſs if he were mentioned no where elſe. But no notice being taken of this Head elſewhere, nor here neither, is little leſs than a Demonſtration that that there was no ſuch Head to be taken notice of.</p>
                     <p>When any one ſhall pretend to ſo high a Prerogative and vaſt a Dependence as this implies, we may in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon expect he ſhould be able to produce ſome very good Evidence of his Right to it. And therefore the meer ſilence of the Scripture is prejudice enough againſt the Pretence. But the ſilence of the Scripture, in ſuch places as I have produced, is a direct Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
                     <p>Nay, Laſtly, The Scripture is ſo far from giving the leaſt intimation of any ſuch <hi>Headſhip,</hi> where the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it was unavoidable, if it had been a Divine Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution;
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:104627:93"/>that it ſeems expreſly to oppoſe it. For St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking againſt thoſe Contentions which happened, by one ſaying I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> another I am of <hi>Apollos,</hi> a third, I am of <hi>Cephas,</hi> he does not oppoſe <hi>Cephas</hi> or <hi>Peter</hi> to the reſt, as if it were lawful for them to ſay, I am of <hi>Peter,</hi> but not, I am of <hi>Paul, &amp;c.</hi> but utterly reproves all ſuch Diſtinctions, and requires them all to be united in <hi>Chriſt. Is Chriſt divided?</hi> ſays he, <hi>Was Paul Crucified for you? Or, were ye Baptized in the Name of Paul?</hi> Plainly ſhewing that to eſtabliſh any mortal Man as the Center of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, is in effect to divide the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and that if we unite our ſelves in ſuch a Head, we may as well be baptized in his Name, and have him for our Saviour too.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As little Foundation is there in Reaſon for this Headſhip of the Pope over the whole Body of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> ſince it will neceſſarily require that all the Chriſtian Churches in the World, even thoſe that are at greateſt Diſtance from one another, be reduced under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and depend upon his Authority; the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which vaſt Power and Truſt is incompatible to any mortal Man. Being veſted in a wiſe and good Man, it could be but of little benefit to a Body ſo diffuſive as the Catholick Church; but in the Hands of a weak or vicious Perſon, it would become the Inſtrument of Pride, Tyranny, Oppreſſion, and Diviſions. A ſmall Biſhoprick requires the utmoſt Care and Prudence to manage it aright; but what Ability, without a Miracle, could be ſufficient for a tolerable diſcharge of ſo great a Truſt, as the Inſpection and Government of the whole Church from one end of the Earth to the other? But the Temptations to abuſe ſuch Power would be infinite, and the Abuſes themſelves intolerable, and hardly capable of Redreſs; as we ſee alſo by no ſmall Experience. For
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:104627:93"/>after that that Power was pretended to at <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſubmitted to by the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Church; the Scandals &amp; Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of this part of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> grew to ſuch an Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, that it could not be diſſembled. Inſomuch that the Cardinals and Prelats appointed by Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Third, to adviſe concerning the ſtate of the Church,<note place="margin">Conſil. de Emend. Eccl. in Richer. <hi>l.</hi> 4.</note> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him that ſhe <hi>was juſt falling head-long into Ruine;</hi> and that the chief Cauſe was, that the Pope's Will and Pleaſure had been the Rule of all his Doings. And he that ſhall conſider what a lewd and filthy place <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf was grown, by their own confeſſion, may obſerve from thence how likely it is that the Government of the Catholick Church ſhould thrive in one Man's hand after another, who are too buſy to attend upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of moſt ſcandalous and crying Diſorders at home.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Neither is there any colour in Antiquity for this Headſhip of the Pope; altho they are the Primitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers upon whoſe Authority chiefly they would ſupport this Uſurpation. The Teſtimonies which the Cardinal has choſen for his Purpoſe, are ſo far from it, that one would wonder to ſee ſo weighty a Superſtructure laid upon ſo weak a Foundation. Thus, becauſe S. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſays that <hi>every Church, i.e. the Faithful who are all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, muſt needs reſort to the Roman Church, becauſe of the more Powerful Principality; i.e.</hi> becauſe the Imperial City drew the Buſineſs of the World to it ſelf, and by conſequence Chriſtians in all parts had occaſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to it; therefore the Biſhop of that City was the Head of all Churches in the World. Becauſe S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> call'd the <hi>Roman the Principal Church, from whence the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Prieſts did ariſe,</hi> and <hi>the Matrix and Root of the Catholick Church:</hi> Therefore he could mean nothing elſe, but that Union to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is abſolutely
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:104627:94"/>neceſſary to a part in Chriſt and his Church: Whereas it is moſt evident, that elſewhere he did freely aſſert the Independence of other Biſhops upon that Biſhop, and of other Epiſcopal Churches upon that Church: And conſequently that he called it the <hi>Principal</hi> Church, as being conſtituted in the Principal City, (ſo <hi>Rigaltius</hi> acknowledgeth); and the Spring of <hi>Sacerdotal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> and <hi>the Root of the Catholick Church,</hi> becauſe Biſhops having occaſion either to come up to <hi>Rome,</hi> or to ſend thither from all parts, did by their Unity with the Church there, manifeſtly declare their Union to one another, which was a convenience, accruing to that Church (and to all others) from the Imperial City in which it was conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted; but by no means inferring that other Churches were more obliged to Union with her, than ſhe with others. Again, becauſe it was ſometimes a Mark of an Orthodox and Catholick Chriſtian to be joyn'd in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop; therefore it muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be ſo, and it can never happen that a Man ſhould be united to the Church, and disjoyn'd from the Pope. Becauſe St. <hi>Hierom</hi> referred himſelf to the Chair of <hi>Peter</hi> when <hi>Damaſus</hi> ſate in it; therefore he would have done the ſame to his Predeceſſor <hi>Liberius,</hi> after he had communicated with the <hi>Arians.</hi> Of the ſame kind is the Argument from <hi>Optatus.</hi> Finally, becauſe St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> thought that <hi>Cecilian</hi> had reaſon to value his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, more than the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his Enemies, in as much as the <hi>Principality of an Apoſtolical Chair had always flouriſhed there;</hi> therefore the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is Head of the Church: As if there were no other Apoſtolical Chair beſides that at <hi>Rome;</hi> and as if the Communion of no other Church was to be eſteemed, when a Biſhop meets with unreaſonable Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, but one that is by virtue of her Chair Miſtreſs
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:104627:94"/>of all the Reſt. For what he ſays out of St. <hi>Auguſtin in Pſal. contra partem Donati,</hi> it has had its Anſwer <hi>p.</hi> 107. Pope <hi>Leo</hi> indeed ſpeaks a little more to the Purpoſe, but without any Authority, as being a Witneſs in his own Cauſe. For it was but a few Years before, that <hi>Zoſimus, Boniface</hi> and <hi>Celeſtin</hi> had ſet up a ſmall pretence to an Univerſal Headſhip, tho nothing was got by it, but a notable Rebuke from the <hi>African</hi> Fathers, whereof St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> was one, for introducing a worldly Pride into the Church. But no wonder if thoſe Popes that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, ſtill kept their Eye upon that Power which their Predeceſſors could not as yet compaſs.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide it appears by moſt unqueſtionable Evidence, that the Primitive Fathers knew no greater neceſſity of being united to the Roman, than to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Catholick or Orthodox Biſhop. When Pope <hi>Victor</hi> took upon him to excommunicate the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches, for not obſerving <hi>Eaſter</hi> as the <hi>Roman</hi> did, they were ſo far from thinking a Union with him as their Head neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to their being Members of the Catholick Church, that they called a Synod of their own, reprehended the Pope's Arrogance, and reſolved to adhere to their own Cuſtom. St. <hi>Cyprian, Firmilian</hi> and the <hi>Africans</hi> did the like, in oppoſition to Pope <hi>Stephen;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Apud Cypr. Ep. 75. <hi>p.</hi> 228. Ed. <hi>Oxon.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Firmilian</hi> plainly telling him, that while he thought to Excommunicate all them from himſelf, he had but excommunicated himſelf from them. In ancient Times there was no ſhadow of any ſuch Headſhip in the Pope, as of late A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges has been contended for. He was treated with no other Titles of Reſpect than other Biſhops were, who were called Popes and Vicars of Chriſt no leſs than he, as he was by them ſtiled their Colleague and Brother, no leſs than they by him. In reſpect of Preſidency over <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches,</hi> his Juriſdiction was confined as well as
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:104627:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>theirs: in reſpect of the common Care of the <hi>whole Church,</hi> each of them was deemed to have an Authority and a Truſt no way inferiour to his: All which our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries do full well underſtand, who are but a little converſant in St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> if they would but ſpeak what they know. But becauſe St. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s Compl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>mt to <hi>Damaſus</hi> is inſiſted upon by the Cardinal; let St. <hi>Hierom</hi> be heard ſpeaking to this very Point ſo clearly, that we cannot deſire he ſhould have been more expreſs; <q>Where-ever, ſaith he, there is a Biſhop, whether at <hi>Rome,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Hier. ad Evagr.

The advantage of Wealth, and the diſadvantage of Poverty, does not make a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop to be higher or lower; but they are all Succeſſors of the Apoſtles.</q> To conclude this Point, Popes have been anciently cenſured, condemned and excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when they were thought to have deſerved it. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> was Excommunicated by the Eaſtern Biſhops;<note place="margin">S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

Did theſe Fathers take the Pope for their Common Head, and the Center of Catholick Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</p>
                     <p>Some Popes have been Hereticks, as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves cannot deny; and therefore time has been when it was ſo far from being a Note of the Catholick Church to be united to the Pope, that it was impoſſible ſo to be without ſeparation from the Catholick Church.</p>
                     <p>But the Cardinal has a very notable Argument to prove the neceſſity of this Union, viz. <hi>Experience;</hi> ſince thoſe Churches have <hi>withered</hi> away, that are divided from this <hi>Head</hi> the Pope: Witneſs the <hi>Aſiatick</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Churches, anciently famous for <hi>numerous Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi>
                        <pb n="149" facs="tcp:104627:95"/>for <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> Men, but ſince their Schiſm from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, reduced to obſcurity, and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into groſs Ignorance.</p>
                     <p>To which it might be enough to anſwer, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though where the Sin is flagrant and beyond contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, there the Calamity that befalls the Offender may without breach of Charity, or impious Intruſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into the Councils of Providence, be well deemed the effect of God's Juſtice: Yet in a Diſpute about Right and Truth, to take advantage from the Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a Man, or of a Church, and to make them an Argument againſt the oppreſſed ſide, is barbarouſly uncharitable and wicked, and becomes none but thoſe who care not by what means they come to their end.</p>
                     <p>But not to pry into the Secrets of Divine Providence; Might it not have ſerved the Cardinal's turn to aſſign the Afflictions and Ignorance of thoſe Churches to the Irruptions of their Enemies upon them, who at length prevailed, and utterly deſtroyed ſome of them, and to this day hold the reſt in Slavery? If this be not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; what if one ſhould add, that their not uniting themſelves to the Pope was indeed one cauſe of their Misfortunes, who had much rather ſee thoſe ancient and glorious Churches laid waſt by Infidels, then ſaved by the united Arms of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> to make a vigorous Oppoſition to his claim of Supremacy?</p>
                     <p>However, it is not more certain that they were once the moſt flouriſhing Churches in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> than that when they were ſo, they did not acknowledg this Union to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> as the Head of the Catholick Church; nay that they oppoſed the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and Preparations to ſo unjuſt a claim; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their denying it at preſent can with no reaſon be alledged as the cauſe of their Diſtreſs.</p>
                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:104627:96"/>
                     <p>One thing more we have to ſay to this doughty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; that if it may be truſted, how comes it to paſs that we have a contrary experience in Churches nearer home, which have not fallen into decay, by ſeparating from the Pope? We are apt to think that from the Reformation to this day, there have been as many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons eminent both for Piety and Learning in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as any Age ever produced in any Nation. That we are not ſunk into <hi>groſs Ignorance,</hi> our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries know by ſome <hi>Experience.</hi> And we may ſay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out need of bluſhing for the matter, that they have felt ſome Learning from this Church, which their Union to the Pope hath of late helped very few of them to.</p>
                     <p>And if we may conclude any thing from the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of thoſe within their own Communion, we ſhall find that the more cloſely any of them are united to this ſuppoſed Head, their Piety and Learning does not flouriſh one jot the more for it. Let the Learning of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church be compared with that of <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Italy;</hi> Let the Piety of the Regulars, eſpecially of the Jeſuits, be weighed with that of the Secular Clergy; and I believe it will appear that this Union is no ſuch excellent advantage either towards Piety or Learning, that they ſhould appeal to Experience to ſhew the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity thereof either to the one or the other. And thus much for their Union to the Pope.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Neither is the Union which they pretend to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, as <hi>Members,</hi> any certain Note of the Church.</p>
                     <p>The Cardinal was not content to deſcribe their Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by <hi>thinking the ſame concerning all Doctrines of Faith;</hi> but will have it to exclude alſo Diſcord, and Diſſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and falling into Sects and Parties.

                     <p n="1">1. This is no more than what any Society may have as well as the true Church; and any other Church as well as the <hi>Roman.</hi> The Members of every Church are thus far united, that they all agree in profeſſing the common Belief of the Society to which they belong. But about other Doctrine they either fall into Diſſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or not, as it happens. And for ſome conſiderable time, they may agree very well, and at length fall out. In which caſe, according to <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Note, they would be the true Church while they agreed, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Faith ſhould be, which is moſt abſurd. It is not whether Men are united among themſelves in what they believe, but whether that wherein they are united be the right Faith, that is to be conſidered. Union in a falſe way is a confederacy in Error; and the more that Men are united in it, the more wiſe or prudent they may ſhew themſelves to be, but never the more Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox. And though the Cardinal produces that Saying of our Saviour; <hi>Every Kingdom divided againſt it ſelf,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matth. xii.</note> 
                        <hi>is brought to deſolation;</hi> to ſhew that Diſcord is a Sign of the Kingdom of the Devil; yet he has manifeſtly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the Place, inaſmuch as our Saviour's Diſcourſe there proceeds upon the contrary ſuppoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Satan is not divided againſt himſelf.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. As there may be this Union out of the true Church, ſo it may not be within it; which makes it plain that this is no certain Note of the Church. It is undeniable that there were Diviſions in the firſt Apoſtolical Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; and conſequently that to be Members of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, it is ſufficient that in thoſe things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Unity of the Faith conſiſts, all ſpeak the ſame thing.</p>
                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:104627:97"/>
                     <p>And if the Cardinal meant that the breaking of a Church into Parties, and the Riſe of Hereſies and Schiſms out of it, is a certain Note of a falſe Church; he might as well have ſaid that there never was a true Church in the World, no not in the Apoſtles times. And if for this Reaſon he would unchurch the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, he did in effect put as good an Argument, as this againſt the Reformation, into the Mouth of a <hi>Turk</hi> or a <hi>Jew</hi> againſt Chriſtianity, that there is no Truth in it at all; and becauſe Chriſtians are ſo divided one againſt another, therefore none of them are in the right. For a more particular Conſideration of this Argument, I refer the Reader to the <hi>Apologetical Vindication of the Church of England,</hi> lately publiſhed.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for the firſt part of this Diſcourſe, which was to ſhew, that the Unity here offered, is not a Note of the Church. I proceed to ſhew,</p>
                     <p n="2">II. <hi>That if it were, yet the Roman Church has it not.</hi> Which is probably true of the Firſt, and moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true of the ſecond Branch of the Cardinal's Unity.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is probable that the Roman Church wants the Firſt; and that there is now no true Pope, nor has been for many Ages, for that Church to be united to. For by their own Confeſſion, a Pope <hi>Simoniacally</hi> choſen, a Pope intruded by Violence, a Heretick, and therefore ſure an Atheiſt or an Infidel, is no true Pope. And many ſuch there have been of one ſort or other; whoſe Acts therefore in creating Cardinals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being invalid, it is exceeding probable that the whole Succeſſion has upon this account failed long ago. Beſides, there have been about 25 Schiſms in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the laſt
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:104627:97"/>of which continued no leſs than 50 Years, wherein two, and ſometimes three Popes pretended to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair, created Cardinals, had their ſeveral Parties and Abettors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> During which Schiſms, it would be a madneſs to ſay that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church was united to the Pope, as Head, when they were all together by the Ears, which of the Anti-Popes was the true one? Now while there was no certain Pope, there could be no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the validity of any Acts neceſſary to continue a Succeſſion of true Popes. But this Caſe having happen'd ſo often, and ſometimes continued for many years, the uncertainty muſt have at laſt grown into an utter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability that they have a Pope, and therefore (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Cardinal) that they are a Church; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be all one whether the Church be united with a Nominal Pope, or a Real Pope; with a True Head, or a Falſe Head, or any Head whatſoever. But,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is undoubtedly true, That the Roman Church has not the ſecond Branch of Unity, <hi>viz.</hi> that Union of the Members to one another, which the Cardinal pretends. Whether by it he means an Union in all points of Doctrine of great Conſequence, amongſt thoſe who remain in the Communion of his pretended Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church; or ſuch an Union of their Members as ſhall prevent the breaking away of ſome from the Communion of the reſt.</p>
                     <p>She has not the former Unity. For if <hi>Philoſophers, Hereticks, &amp;c.</hi> have had their <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Parties,</hi> and been at great Diſſenſions among themſelves; ſo have the Members of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church too.</p>
                     <p>He pretends that all the <hi>Sacred Writers of their Church do wonderfully agree.</hi> Now to let paſs his Preſumption, in ſuppoſing the ancient Doctors of the Church to be one part of theſe their Writers, we will for the preſent
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:104627:98"/>admit it, and only ask, If they agreed ſo wonderfully with the Fathers, what need there was of an <hi>Index Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgatorius</hi> upon the Fathers to make them and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of <hi>Trent</hi> agree ſomething better?</p>
                     <p>He pretends that the Decrees of their <hi>Lawful</hi> Councils agree in<note n="*" place="margin">In omnibus Dogmatibus inter ſe conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niunt.</note> 
                        <hi>all Doctrines.</hi> Juſt ſo the Councils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> decreeing, That all Power, even the <hi>Papal,</hi> was in things appertaining to Religion, to be ſubject to the Council; agreed with the Abolition of the <hi>Pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Sanction, by the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, under <hi>Leo</hi> X, by which the Council is made to truckle to the Pope. As to which, and other Inſtances of the like ſort, no help is to be had from that Qualification of <hi>Lawful</hi> Councils; ſince what the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> will not own to be a Lawful Council, is by other Parties in that Church owned to be ſo. And that Church muſt needs be at wonderful Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty within it ſelf, that cannot ſo much as agree what Councils are Lawful, and what are not. And yet if they were ſo agreed, their Church-Unity is not to be bragged of, when there are enough amongſt them to make an unlawful Council, and to determin otherwiſe in a point of ſo vaſt Conſequence, as that above-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, than they ought to do. For if in the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, one Council determines one way, and another the contrary way, that Communion cannot be ſaid to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree ever the more, for one being a lawful and the other an unlawful Council.</p>
                     <p>Whereas he pretends that the Decrees of Popes are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo at Unity with one another, one would expect that in the next place Fire and Water ſhould be brought in for an Example of Agreement too: For they may be made to agree, as ſoon as the Decrees of many Popes. <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Gelaſius</hi> condemned receiving in one kind;<note place="margin">De Conſecr. Diſt. 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 12.</note> Have there been no Popes ſince that condemned the contrary?
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:104627:98"/>
                        <hi>Nicholas</hi> IV determined that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was a Beggar,<note place="margin">Extravag. Joh. <hi>Tit.</hi> 14. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.</note> and had Right to nothing; but <hi>John</hi> XXII comes not long after him, and makes it Heretical ſo to ſay. It has been ſo frequent a practice for Popes to overthrow the Decrees of their Predeceſſors, that it were endleſs to recount the particulars.</p>
                     <p>As for the Writers which they may juſtly claim to themſelves; how <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſhould come to fancy ſuch a wonderful Agreement, is very ſtrange, who in his own Controverſies has obſerved ſo many notable Differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them.<note place="margin">De Concil. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. &amp; alibi.</note> Was it not <hi>Bellarmin</hi> that obſerved ſeveral Catholick Writers to have agreed with the Hereticks, in aſſerting the Council to be above the Pope? And that as thoſe did not agree with themſelves, ſo neither did the other ſide of Canoniſts and School-men that aſſerted the contrary? And this is no trifling Queſtion neither. Such Diſagreement is noted by the ſame Cardinal upon other material Points, <hi>viz.</hi> Concerning the Pope's Temporal Power; Whether Vows of ſingle Life are diſpenſable? What Worſhip may be given to Images? Whether Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of God may be made or not? Whether Extream Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and other of their Sacraments were inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Whether Intention be neceſſary to a Sacrament? Whether an expreſs purpoſe of forſaking Sin be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Contrition? Whether good Works be truly meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious? And concerning many more Queſtions, in moſt of which, ſome or other of themſelves have held as Proteſtants do, againſt the reſt of their Church.</p>

I confeſs the Divinity of the New Methodiſts, the <hi>French</hi> Expoſitor, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Repreſenter, has as yet occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned but little diſturbance in that Communion, for which I know a good Reaſon.

                        </note> I do not ſee but from this time forward their Unity may be inviolable, now that they have got the Knack of making Contradictions agree with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>But to all ſuch Inſtances as theſe <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied them with a ready Anſwer; That <hi>they differ not in thoſe things that belong to Faith.</hi> Upon which cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Anſwer, one would be apt to enquire how nearly a Queſtion in Religion muſt be allied to the <hi>Faith,</hi> before it may be ſaid to <hi>belong to it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Cardinal himſelf tells us now and then of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing held by Catholicks that is <hi>fere haereticum,</hi> as he calls it, <hi>almoſt heretical,</hi> in which caſe the Queſtion ſhould be alſo <hi>almoſt of Faith,</hi> and may be ſaid to <hi>belong</hi> to it. But if he means ſimply that <hi>they all agree in Matters of Faith,</hi> as he ſays afterward; and that <hi>all Catholicks ſay the ſame thing about Doctrines of Faith,</hi> as we were told before; we are willing to hear him. But then we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> ſhould be heard too, when to the Papiſts char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them with ſome <hi>Differences,</hi> they make the ſame Anſwer, that they have all the ſame <hi>Faith;</hi> eſpecially ſince when they come to prove the Truth of what they
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:104627:99"/>ſay, they will ſhew that the Matters wherein they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer do not break the Unity of the Catholick Faith: which is ſomething a better Argument than the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal produces for the Unity of his Party in matters of Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> that they all <hi>profeſs to believe that which ſhall be judged neceſſary to be believed in the Roman Catholick Church.</hi> For to ſay no more to this at preſent; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this Profeſſion, we are very ſure that ſome of them take thoſe things to be matters of Faith, which others do not, if we may believe them; of which the <hi>Infallibility of the Pope,</hi> and the <hi>Depoſing Doctrine</hi> are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and undeniable Inſtances.</p>
                     <p>But now, if by the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the Members,</hi> ſhould be meant ſuch a Union as will hinder the ſeparation of ſome from the reſt; then this Note muſt not by any means be pretended to in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> from which ſo many Churches that once were in Communion with her, have broken away. Indeed he does not expreſly ſay that he means this by the Union of the Members a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves; but ſome ſuch thing he muſt mean, or elſe by virtue of this Note he does impertinently run down the <hi>Lutherans</hi> as being Hereticks, becauſe they have begotten ſo many Sects, which, as he pretends, charge each other with <hi>Hereſy.</hi> And then it may as truly be ſaid that the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in whoſe Communion we were before the Reformation, wants the Mark of Unity, becauſe ſo many have broken away from her; as that any other Churches want it, becauſe ſome have alſo divided from them. For 'tis very idle to ſay, that tho we were Members of that Church when we firſt began to differ from it, yet that by our Diviſions we cut our ſelves from her Communion, and therefore that the Unity of her Communion is not affected by our Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For thus we may as well excuſe all the ſeparations
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:104627:100"/>from ours or from any other Church, <hi>viz.</hi> that by ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating from us, they no longer belong to us. We are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry confident that in all Points of Doctrine of any great moment, we of the Church of <hi>England</hi> do agree much more together, than thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and as for them who have gone out from us, they as little break the Unity of the reſt whom they are gone from, as <hi>Luther</hi>'s departing from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> broke the Unity of thoſe who ſtill remained in it. So that either the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> muſt renounce her pretence to Unity upon this account, that Sects and Parties have not broken away from her; or ſhe muſt ſet up this wiſe Note of the true Church, that all her Members are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, except thoſe that are divided from her; which is a Mark that will fit any Society in the World.</p>
                     <p>But the Cardinal does here offer a difference between the Diviſion of Hereticks from the Church, and a Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from Hereſy; <q>That in their Church they have a certain Rule for ending Controverſies, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the chief Paſtor, or the Definition of a general Council; and therefore Diſſenſion does not ariſe among them from the Doctrine of the Church, but from the Malice of the Devil.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now in anſwer to this, not to be importunate with that Queſtion, That if theſe be the ways of compounding Controverſies, how comes it to paſs that their Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies ſtill remain? I would know,</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) Why were not theſe the means of compoſing thoſe Controverſies that carried us away from them? Our Fathers were once of their Communion, and thoſe means were not ſufficient to retain them in it. To ſay this <hi>aroſe from the Malice of the Devil,</hi> is to ſay in effect that the Devil was in 'em; which is a little too Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial for a Controvertiſt though he were a Cardinal.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:104627:100"/>Unleſs he reſolves to aſcribe it to the Devil that they were taken off from an implicit Faith and a blind Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> For it ſeems to be ſome Peoples Opinion, when Men begin to judg a little for themſelves, the Spirit of Hereſy comes in, and then away they go. But from hence I gather that the Sentence of the Pope, or of a plenary Council, is no certain Rule for ending Controverſies, nor certain means of preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Diviſions; if ſome other means be not uſed to keep Men from <hi>trying the Spirits</hi> and <hi>proving all things.</hi> What they are, the Cardinal knew very well, but mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them not, nor ſhall I need to do it. In the mean time, when whole Countries went off from that Church as ſoon as they had a little conſidered what they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved upon her Authority, I need not ſay, whether the Separation was cauſed by <hi>the Doctrine of that Church,</hi> or by the <hi>Malice of the Devil,</hi> but leave the World to judg. But,</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) How could thoſe be certain means of compoſing Controverſies, concerning which even in their own Church there were the greateſt Controverſies of all? What deference is to be given to the Sentence of their chief Paſtor, has always been a great Diſpute amongſt them, and the beſt, if not the greateſt Part of their Church do not think him infallible. Nor is it yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed what is requiſite to make the Sentence of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council deciſive, nor of thoſe Councils that have contradicted one another, which they are to follow. And that cannot be a certain Rule for deciding Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, which is it ſelf controverted. So that they have neither that Union of Members among themſelves, nor thoſe certain means of Union which they pretend to have.</p>

                           <hi>P.</hi> 450.</note> That however <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s might be preferrable, if either of them were neceſſary; yet it will be hard for Catholicks to make their Complaints of Innovating, which they heap up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Hereticks, to appear juſt, ſo long as they themſelves ſhall retain ſuch a Novel Definition; and that if <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry VIIths</hi> Rule were obſerved, <hi>viz. That nothing ſhould be drawn into Example or Authority, which is contrary to the Fathers;</hi> then even this his Definition, tho it had been received, yet ought to be rejected. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that <hi>Accurate Writer,</hi> as he is deſervedly called by<note n="‖" place="margin">Letter to Bp. of <hi>Linc.</hi> p. <hi>319.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>F. Walſh,</hi> has argued to the utter confuſion of the Cardinal's Argument from Union with the Pope <hi>as Head,</hi> or of the <hi>Members among themſelves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For how can that be a Note of the True Church now, which never was thought to belong to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it for 1500 Years together, and which their own <hi>moſt Learned Lovers of Antiquity,</hi> and <hi>Pious Oppoſers of Novelty,</hi> do not think eſſential to it at this Day?</p>
                     <p>And where is the ſo much boaſted Conſent of the Members amongſt themſelves in all Matters of Faith?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I believe the holy Catholick Church,</hi> is an Article of Faith. I would know of thoſe Gentlemen who are at ſuch perfect agreement amongſt themſelves, what this Church is? <hi>Bellarmine</hi> anſwers one thing, <hi>Caniſius</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo contrary, that if one ſpeaks true, the other muſt needs have told me that which is falſe. And while the Definition of the former is followed by ſome, and that of the later, which is the worſe, is more generally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; <hi>Launoy,</hi> and many more of the moſt Learned ſort, ſtick to the Antients, who are as different from both, as they are from one another. And yet after all we
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:104627:102"/>muſt be told that they are perfectly agreed in all matters of Faith; and that this inviſible unintelligible Union ſhews plainly that the <hi>Roman</hi> is the true Church. One would hardly think that they are in earneſt; unleſs by Union they mean an equal Reſolution to carry on the Diſpute as long as they can contend and no longer: Which kind of Union is to be met with almoſt every Term in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall; where one may ſee two Parties proſecuting one another with all imaginable vigour, who yet reſolve to be quiet, when the Bench has made them ſo. Not that the Party who is caſt in the Suit muſt needs change his Opinion of his own Cauſe, becauſe the laſt Verdict was againſt him; but that if a new Trial will not be granted, he is bound to <hi>acquieſce</hi> in the Judgment of the Court, becauſe it has a Sheriff, with the <hi>Poſſe Comitatus,</hi> to put it into Execution. Thus they that make the Sentence of the Pope, and they that make the Sentence of a Council, the Sentence of the Church, are united in a Reſolution to ſtand to the Arbitrement of the Church; there being a certain ſenſible Obligation upon them to profeſs that they will acquieſce in its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination: But in the mean time they may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly quarrel amongſt themſelves, about Queſtions of ſuch mighty Importance as that we mentioned even now, and this without breach of Union amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; till the Sentence of the Pope, or the Sentence of a <hi>Plenary Council,</hi> or the Sentence of both, comes to part them: Which yet will be long enough firſt, if each ſide of the Queſtion be abetted with numerous and able Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that are at preſent both of 'em reſolved to ſubmit ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to the Church; leſt one of them upon an unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Sentence ſhould be provoked to change its Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. And thus, as we obſerved before, the Queſtion about the <hi>Immaculate Conception</hi> has been left undecided
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:104627:103"/>ſo long, leſt by determining that, a more dangerous Queſtion ſhould be raiſed by the diſobliged Party. But if it ſhould ſo happen that the Church cannot well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void declaring her ſelf in ſuch a Caſe, this new-faſhion'd Union goes forward ſtill, tho ſhe ſpeaks ſo ambiguouſly, that each Party fancies the Sentence to be on its own ſide; which was done often at <hi>Trent</hi> with great Application and Art: Particularly in the Decrees concerning <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Aſſurance of being Juſtified, &amp;c.</hi> Which being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, <hi>Soto</hi> and <hi>Vega</hi> differed not only as much, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than they did at firſt: for now they had a new Queſtion to debate, <hi>viz.</hi> on which ſide the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil had decreed; and ſo they fell to writing great Books upon it, againſt one another: But for all this they were admirably agreed, becauſe they agreed in ſubmiſſion to the Council. I proceed to ſhew,</p>
                     <p n="3">III. That <hi>that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity which is indeed a Note of the Church, we have, and that in a much greater degree than they.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which Point will, I hope, yield ſome Diſcourſe, that will be more uſeful, than barely to diſcover Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, and expoſe Sophiſtry. For here I ſhall repreſent, as well as I can, the true Grounds and Notions of Church-Unity, and then ſee who has moſt reaſon to pretend to it, they or we.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There is the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of ſubmitting to <hi>one</hi> Head, our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> which is the Foundation of all other Chriſtian Unity, and therefore mentioned by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> amongſt the principal Reaſons why the Church is <hi>one Body,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. iv. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>One Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of profeſſing the Common <hi>Faith</hi> that was <hi>once delivered to the Saints,</hi> which is grounded
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:104627:103"/>upon the Authority of the Scriptures, and ſummarily expounded in the Antient Creeds. And therefore to <hi>One Lord,</hi> the Apoſtle in the forementioned place adds, <hi>one Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. There is an Unity of Sacraments in the Church, <hi>One Baptiſm;</hi> by which we are all admitted into the ſame ſtate of Duties and of Priviledges, undertaking the Conditions of the New Covenant, and gaining a Right to the Promiſes thereof. Thus ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. xii. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>By one Spirit we are all Baptized into one Body:</hi> And the like U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is inferred from the other Sacraments.<note place="margin">1 Cor. x. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>We being many are one Bread, and one Body, for we are all partakers of that one Bread.</hi> And again, <hi>we are all made to drink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. There is alſo an Unity of Obedience to all the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions and Laws of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is an Instance of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that ought by no means to be forgotten; this being no leſs a common Duty than the Profeſſion of the Faith, the performance whereof uniteth us effectually to him, as to our Head, and maketh us living Members of his Body.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. There is the Unity of Chriſtian Affection and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Kindneſs, of which our Lord ſpake when he ſaid, <hi>By this ſhall all Men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye love one another.</hi> Thus St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. xii.</note> 
                        <hi>The Members ſhould have the ſame care one of another,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. There is an Unity of Diſcipline and Government; which is maintained chiefly by retaining for ſubſtance the ſame Form that was left in the Church by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, by the Biſhops and Paſtors confederating together, as much as may be for the edification of their Flocks; by regarding every Regular Act of Authority in one Church, as the Act of the whole, and giving no occaſion to breach of Chriſtian-Communion, by abuſing a lawful, or by claiming an undue Authority, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:104627:104"/>
                     <p n="7">7. There is likewiſe an Unity of Communion in the Service and Worſhip of God, in <hi>glorifying God with one Mouth,</hi> in joining in the ſame Religious Aſſemblies, for Prayer and Sacraments, for Acts of common Piety and Devotion according to the Rules of the Goſpel. I need not mention any more Inſtances of Chriſtian <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> ſince thoſe that are more particular, may be eaſily deduced from theſe.</p>
                     <p>Now to ſpeak clearly, there <hi>ought to be</hi> all theſe kinds and Inſtances of Unity in the Church; but we ſee evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently that they are not all there, I mean in every Part and Member of the Church. And therefore they are not all neceſſary to the Being of a Church, how neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoever they may be, whether to the Wellbeing of it, or to the Salvation of thoſe Perſons whereof the Church conſiſts. But ſome of them are neceſſary to the Being of the Church; and they are the acknowledgment of the <hi>one Lord,</hi> the Profeſſion of the <hi>one Faith,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into the ſtate of Chriſtian Duties and Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges by <hi>one Baptiſm.</hi> And this is all that I can find ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to the Being of a Church, inaſmuch as the Apoſtle ſays, That <hi>we are all baptized into one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi> And therefore ſo far as <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> in theſe things is ſpread and obtains in the World, ſo far and no farther is the Body of the Church propagated, becauſe it is one by this Unity. But then indeed there ought to be a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Unity, an Unity of obſerving all the Inſtitutions of our Lord Jeſus, an Unity of Chriſtian Charity and good Will, an Unity of Government and Diſcipline, an Unity of Communion in Religious Aſſemblies, to which I will add alſo that there ought to be an Unity of Care to keep out of the Communion of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> all dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Errors and unlawful Practices. And when ſuch begin to appear, much more if they have taken root and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:104627:104"/>are grown to a ſcandal, to root them out again. But Unity in theſe things does not run through the whole Church, or through that Body which is one in the three former Reſpects; and therefore it muſt neceſſarily be granted that the Church is not one Body in thoſe later Reſpects, tho it ought to be ſo.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe theſe are proper Inſtances of Church-U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, tho not abſolutely neceſſary to the Being of the Church, therefore it cannot be denied that thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches which keep Unity in theſe Reſpects bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than others do, have the Mark of Eccleſiaſtical U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in a higher Degree than thoſe others, inaſmuch as they have not only that Unity which is a Mark of a true Church, but that alſo which is the Mark of a pure Church; and are not only one Body in thoſe things, without which they could not be Parts of the Catholick Church, but one alſo in thoſe things, wherein all other Parts of the Church ought to be one with them.</p>
                     <p>We therefore according to Truth, allow the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be a Part of the Catholick Church, becauſe ſhe holds that <hi>one Lord,</hi> that <hi>one Faith,</hi> that <hi>one Baptiſm,</hi> which we hold, &amp; without which there were no Church at all: And thus far ſhe maintains Catholick Unity.</p>
                     <p>But inaſmuch as ſhe hath violated the Inſtitution of our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> concerning the other Sacrament, as in other Reſpects, ſo by withholding the Cup from the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, notwithſtanding he ſaid, <hi>Drink ye all of this,</hi> and that the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>We are all made to drink into one Spirit,</hi> even all that belong to the Body of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> ſhe has departed from Catholick Unity, the Unity of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe ſhe will not be content to be a Siſter, but claims to be the Mother and Mistreſs of all other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches, and has advanced her Biſhop to be
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:104627:105"/>Head and Monarch of the whole Church, and will have Commuion with no other Chriſtian Society but ſuch as will be content to become her Subjects, and will allow no Act of Eccleſiaſtical Authority to be valid, but in a State of Dependence upon her, ſhe has therefore depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Catholick Unity of Government and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe ſhe has brought the <hi>Sacrifice of the Maſs, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, Purgatory, Invocation of Saints,</hi> &amp;c. into her Creed, and Practices ſuitable to ſuch falſe Doctrines into her Worſhip, ſhe has departed from that Purity of profeſſing the Faith <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in which all Churches ſhould be <hi>one.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And becauſe ſhe will have no Communion with us but upon theſe Terms, which are impoſſible, ſhe has departed from the Unity of Catholick Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                     <p>Finally, Becauſe ſhe has purſued all Chriſtians that dare to open their Mouths againſt theſe Innovations, with <hi>Anathema's,</hi> &amp;c. and ſacrificed the Lives of innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Chriſtians to her reſentments, ſhe has depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Unity of Catholick Charity.</p>
                     <p>With theſe things the Church of <hi>England</hi> cannot be charged, nor with any ſuch things as theſe, not truly and juſtly, I am ſure. In her Worſhip and Aminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacraments, ſhe tranſgreſſeth not the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the Lord; in her Government ſhe encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es not upon the Liberty of other Churches. To her Creed ſhe hath added no Novelties: To her Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhe hath annex'd no unlawful Conditions; ſhe doth not unchurch thoſe Parts of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> that hold the Unity of the Faith, no not that Church it ſelf, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which has added thereunto ſo many enormous Innovations. She hath not embroiled the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:104627:105"/>World, nor waſted Countries with violence. Upon ſuch accounts as theſe, ſhe hath the Mark of <hi>Chriſtian <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> incomparably more than the other Church.</p>
                     <p>From ſuch diſtinct notions of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> as I have laid down, it is evident that nothing can be more idle than to ſeek for a Church by that Mark of Unity which the Cardinal lays down, which comes to no more than this, that Men be all of a mind, that there be no Diviſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſince it is not meerly Unity that is a Mark of the true Church, but Unity in the true Faith; nor is Unity the Mark of a pure Church, unleſs it be upon Terms of Obedience to God, of Charity to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, of keeping the Faith unmixed with Errors and Innovations, and the Worſhip of God free from materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Defects and forbidden Practices.</p>
                     <p>From hence alſo the Folly of that conceit may be eaſily diſcerned, that in this divided State of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> there muſt be one Church which is the only Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> excluſively to all the reſt, that are not in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with her: Which is as much as to ſay, that becauſe there is not that Unity amongſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> which there ought to be, therefore there is none at all; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not united in <hi>one Communion,</hi> therefore they are not united in <hi>one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm.</hi> That fond Principle now mentioned, is advanced by the <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> for the ſake of this Inference; that becauſe we grant the Church to be but one, and withall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg them to be a true Church; therefore we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divided from them, can be no true Church our ſelves: That is to ſay, becauſe we acknowledg, that they have that one Faith, in which all that are united belong to the Church, therefore we are out of the Church our ſelves who have the Unity
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:104627:106"/>of that Faith too, and moreover the Unity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving all the Inſtitutions of Chriſt, and the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Catholick Terms of Communion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which they have not.</p>
                     <p>If ſome part of the Church gives juſt cauſe of Offence, or if another takes Offence where none is given, this is indeed contrary to the Duty of the Members of the Church, but not utterly inconſiſtent with their being Members of it. And if St. <hi>Paul</hi> was in the right when he ſaid. <hi>If the Foot ſhall ſay, becauſe I am not the Head, I am not of the Body, is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not of the Body?</hi> It will be alſo true, that tho the Foot ſhould ſay to the Hand, thou art not of the Body, becauſe thou art not the Foot, the Hand would be of the Body for all that.</p>
                     <p>As for the Unity of Communion which they boaſt ſo much of in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> I ſay 'tis an Unity of Communion <hi>among themſelves,</hi> but 'tis not the <hi>Catholick</hi> Unity of Communion, becauſe the Terms of it are many of them unjuſt and unlawful; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> having as much Unity of Communion among our ſelves as they, have this alſo to ſay, as we have abundantly ſhewn, that the Terms of our Communion are every one of them juſt and lawful, and therefore ours is a Catholick Unity. If there are ſome <hi>Proteſtants</hi> that will not communicate with us, it is no more our Fault, than that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> refuſe to do ſo. And tho in point of <hi>Intereſt</hi> this tends to weaken, yet in <hi>Controverſy</hi> it cannot prejudice the common cauſe of Reformation. That part of the <hi>West</hi> that has left the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may labour under Diſcords, that affect their very Communion, while ſhe her ſelf does not, and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:104627:106"/>yet in the Cauſe againſt her they may be all in the Right. Where Truth is maintained againſt a corrupt Church, there may yet be Diſobedience to Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, overvaluing Queſtions of no great moment, a greater ſtreſs laid upon Opinions and Practices than the Cauſe will bear, and this ſhall be ſufficient to break <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Communion. And at the ſame time groſs Errors may be maintained, and with one conſent impoſed upon the World by the other Church, and all the while, the Differences how weighty ſoever that happen by the bye, may be ſo over-ruled by Force and Power, and the ſenſible Intereſts of this World, that they ſhall not affect their Communion with one another. But for the Reaſons already laid down, it were a fond thing to chuſe a Church by the Mark of ſuch Unity.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, If we would in all Reſpects keep within the Unity of the Church, this muſt be done by profeſſing true Doctrine, by leading good Lives, by a charitable Spirit and Behaviour towards all Chriſtians, by frequenting Prayers and Sacraments, and by ſubmitting to the Authority of our lawful Guides in all things of Indifference and Expedience: And then we may be ſure that whatever others do, <hi>we keep the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace.</hi> And though the Church after all is not that <hi>one Body</hi> in all Reſpects which it ought to be, and which it would be if all Men did their Duty, yet that we our ſelves are ſuch Members of that one Body as we ought to be, and as all others ought to be likewiſe. Now all this Unity we may keep in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but we
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:104627:107"/>cannot keep it all in the Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as the Terms thereof now ſtand. But if this Unity be not enough, when once the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> can prove that Union to the Pope as Head of the Church, and Union to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in all that ſhe believes and teaches, is alſo neceſſary to our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Church, or even to our maintaining that Unity which ought to be amongſt all <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> we will alſo acknowledg the Pope's Supremacy, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as the <hi>Roman</hi> Church believes; but not till then.</p>

                     <p>SEeing the New Covenant is the Charter upon which the Church of Chriſt is founded, and all the Bleſſings which this Covenant promiſes, are appropriated to that Sacred Society; to be in Communion with it is doubtleſs a matter of vaſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the Souls of Men, and it being ſo, it is not to be imagined but that the bleſſed Jeſus (the moſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and careful Friend of Souls that ever was) hath been ſufficiently mindful to leave ſuch plain, and eaſy Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions behind him, how we may find his Church, and ſatisfy our ſelves whether we are in Fellowſhip with it or no, as that neither the Learned, nor Unlearned may be left in the dark for reſolution in ſuch a momentous Enquiry.

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:104627:108"/>of Religion, which our Saviour left plain and obvious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to all Capacities, is too notorious; and in nothing more than in this, how to diſcover and find out the true Church: In order to which her moſt Learned Doctors (and particularly Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi>) have given us cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Notes; by which, as they pretend, the true Church may be diſtinguiſhed, by honeſt and diligent Enquiries, from all falſe Churches whatſoever.

                     <p n="1">I. What it is that the Cardinal here means by Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Doctrine? To which, in ſhort, I anſwer, That which he means by it, is, the Profeſſion of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, both as to Doctrine of Faith, and Doctrine of Manners, without any mixture of Error. For ſo he explains himſelf, <hi>The true Church is not only Catholick, and Apoſtolick, and One, but alſo Holy according to the</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinopolitan
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:104627:108"/>
                        <hi>Creed; but its evident the Church is ſaid to be Holy, becauſe its Profeſſion is Holy, containing nothing falſe as to Doctrine of Faith, nothing unjuſt as to Doctrine of Manners.</hi> And a little after, <hi>By this Note,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it's evident that no Church but ours, is a true Church: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no Sect either of</hi> Pagans <hi>or</hi> Philoſophers, <hi>or</hi> Jews, <hi>or</hi> Turks, <hi>or</hi> Hereticks, <hi>which doth not contain ſome Errors that have been exploded, and are manifeſtly contrary to right Reaſon.</hi> By which it's evident that he excludes all ſorts of Errors from that Profeſſion of Religion, which he here ſets up as a Mark of the true Church. And therefore, after he had given a brief Enumeration of the Errors of all other Sects, as well of <hi>Pagans,</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Mahometans,</hi> as of <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> He thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, <hi>But as for our Catholick Church it teaches no Error, no Turpitude, nothing againſt Reaſon,</hi> (no not excepting Tranſubſtantiation) <hi>though many things above Reaſon; therefore ſhe alone is abſolutely Holy, and to her alone apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains what we ſay in our Creed, I believe the Holy Church.</hi> In which Words he expreſly points and directs us to his Catholick Church, by this Mark or Note, <hi>That it teaches no Error, &amp;c.</hi> By which it is evident that <hi>Sanctity of Doctrine,</hi> in the Cardinal's Senſe, conſiſts in an unerring profeſſion of the true Religion, without any ſo much as the leaſt intermixture of Error. Now tho it is certain that that is the beſt and pureſt Church, which hath the leaſt of Error and Corruption in its Doctrine and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, yet it is as certain that that which is the beſt Church, is not the only true Church: For the only true Church, is the Catholick Church, which conſiſts of a great many particular Churches; whereof ſome are more, and ſome leſs pure from Error and Corruption, and yet all of 'em true Churches: For all particular Bodies and Societies of Chriſtians that are true parts of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:104627:109"/>the Catholick Church, are true Churches, as being Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogenious Parts of the Catholick Church; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently partaking of the ſame common Nature with it. But when we are diſcourſing of the Notes of the true Church, that which we mean by 'em is, ſuch certain Marks and Characters by which an honeſt Enquirer may diſtinguiſh ſuch Societies of Chriſtians as are the true Churches, of which the true Catholick Church conſiſts, from ſuch as are not; and therefore that can be no true Note of the true Church, which doth not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh it from all falſe Churches, and whoſe contrary is conſiſtent with the being of a true Church. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed therefore,</p>
                     <p n="2">II. To ſhew that Sanctity of Doctrine, according to <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Senſe of it, that is a pure profeſſion of true Religion, without any intermixture of Error, is no true Note, or Mark, or Character, by which any honeſt Enquirer can certainly diſtinguiſh the true Church from all falſe Churches. And this I doubt not will evidently appear, if we conſider what are the neceſſary Properties of all true Notes, by which things are to be known and diſtinguiſhed; and they are theſe four.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Every true Note ought to be common to all, of the ſame kind with the thing which it notifies.</item>
                        <item>2. It ought to be proper and peculiar to that kind of Thing, of which it is a Note, and not common to Things of another kind.</item>
                        <item>3. It ought to be more known than the Thing which it notifies.</item>
                        <item>4. It ought to be inſeparable to it. The three laſt of which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf owns to be neceſſary Properties of every true Note, <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. though the firſt he did not think meet to take notice of for a Reaſon beſt known to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:104627:109"/>himſelf, if therefore this Note according to <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s ſenſe of it, hath neither of theſe Properties belonging to it, it can be no true Note of the true Church; and that none of 'em do belong to it, I doubt not but I ſhall make it evidently appear.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p n="1">1. Firſt, Every true Note ought to be common to all of the ſame kind with the thing which it notifies. Thus every true Note of a true Man, for inſtance, ought to be common to all human kind; and ſo every true Note of every wiſe Man ought to be common to all wiſe Men; and by the ſame Rule, every true Note of the true Church ought to be common to all true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: For ſeeing the true Church is nothing elſe but only a Collection of all true Churches, whatſoever is a certain Note of <hi>the</hi> true Church, muſt neceſſarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to <hi>all</hi> true Churches in the World. And indeed ſince the end of our enquiry after the true Church is, that we may communicate with it; and ſince we can no otherwiſe communicate with the true Church, but by communicating with ſome particular Church that is a true part of it; the proper uſe of the Notes of the true Church is to direct our Enquirers, whether this or that Church be a true part of it? or, which is the ſame thing, whether by communicating with this or that particular Church we do communicate with the true Catholick Church? And therefore unleſs the Notes of the true Catholick Church are ſuch, as do appertain to all true Churches, they can never give us any certain direction in what Church we may communicate with the true Catholick Church: for ſeeing we can commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with the true Catholick Church in none but a true Church, no Note can give us any certain directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on where to communicate with the Catholick Church, but what directs us to a true Church; and no Note
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:104627:110"/>can certainly direct us to a true Church, but what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to all true Churches. If therefore not to err in its Profeſſion be a certain Note whereby to find the true Catholick Church, it muſt neceſſarily belong to all true Churches, and conſequently that can be no true Church, which in any inſtance whatſoever errs in its Profeſſion; and indeed ſeeing all the true Churches in the World, are only ſo many ſimular parts of the true Catholick Church, and the true Catholick Church is only the whole of all thoſe ſimuular parts, or all true Churches together, whatſoever the Catholick Church is beſides its being the whole, all the true Churches muſt be of, which it doth conſiſt; and conſequently, if that be unerring, theſe muſt be ſo alſo: for how is it poſſible that the whole which conſiſts of all the parts, ſhould be unerring, unleſs all the parts are unerring? if therefore not to err in its Profeſſion, be a true Note of the true Church, all true Churches muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly partake of it; and conſequently all thoſe muſt be falſe Churches which profeſs any Error; than which there is ſcarce any Propoſition in Religion more notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly falſe. 'Tis true, whatſoever Church errs in any Fundamental Article of Religion, doth thereby ceaſe from being a true Church, becauſe thoſe Articles are the very Foundations upon which every true Church ſtands; and therefore when any Church removes them, or any of them, it muſt neceſſarily ſink from the very being of a true Church into a falſe and heretical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; but there are many Errors which do not at all touch, or in the leaſt affect the Fundamentals of Religion, and theſe a true Church may poſſibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, and yet maintain her Foundations firm and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken; and ſo long as a Church profeſſes all thoſe Truths which are neceſſary to the being of a true
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:104627:110"/>Church, it is ſo far a true Church, tho together with that it ſhould profeſs contrary to ſome other Truths which are not neceſſary to the being of a true Church: for how can its profeſſing any Error which doth not contradict any Truth which is neceſſary to the <hi>being</hi> of a true Church, make it ceaſe to <hi>be</hi> a true Church? or how can that be a falſe Church upon the account of its Profeſſion, which profeſſes all thoſe Truths which are neceſſary to the founding and conſtituting a true Church? If the profeſſion of every Error in Religion be ſufficient to deſtroy the verity of a Church, then the profeſſion of every Truth muſt be neceſſary to found it; becauſe every true Church being founded upon Truth, there is no Error can deſtroy it, but what takes away the Truth which founds; and therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be founded upon the Profeſſion of every Truth, it cannot be deſtroyed by the Profeſſion of every Error; and conſequently none can be true Churches but ſuch as profeſs every true Propoſition in Religion; which being admitted, the Profeſſion of every true Church muſt contain almoſt as many Articles, as it ſelf doth contain Communicants. And indeed if none can be true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches but ſuch as profeſs no Errors, no two Churches whatſoever can differ in any Opinion, tho never ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, but one of the two muſt be a falſe Church; becauſe where-ever there is a difference in Opinion, there muſt be an Error on one ſide or other: as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; There was a very early difference in Opinion between the Eaſtern and Weſtern Churches about the time of the Celebration of Eaſter; in which, if either of them were in the right, to be ſure the other muſt be erroneous, and if neither, both: Did then the erring Church continue a true Church or no, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Error? if it did, then a true Church may err in
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:104627:111"/>its Profeſſion and yet be a true Church ſtill; if it did not, then both were falſe Churches; becauſe tho each believed that the other err'd, yet for a great while they mutually owned each other for true Churches; in which (if every Error deſtroys the verity of a Church) they both of 'em err'd, and thereupon both ceaſe to be true Churches. And if we enquire into the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which now pretends to be the only true Church in the World, we ſhall find that in ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, it profeſſes now, quite contrary to what it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt heretofore: <hi>Vid. Note 3d,</hi> p. 65. Either therefore the Profeſſion of ſome Errors is conſiſtent with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a true Church, or the Roman Church muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have been a falſe Church heretofore, or be a falſe Church now; and ſeeing the Roman Church now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of ſeveral Churches, ſome of which profeſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to one another (as particularly in that celebrated Queſtion, Whether the Pope be Superiour to a General Council, or a General Council to the Pope?) it's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that if either of 'em are in the right, there muſt be an erroneous Profeſſion on one ſide or other. And if the Roman Church err in any of its parts, how can it be unerring in the whole? which is nothing but all the parts together: for if ſhe allow any Church to be a true Church, or part of the true Church, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes any Error, ſhe errs herſelf (ſuppoſing an uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Profeſſion to be a true Note of the true Church) and conſequently is herſelf a falſe Church; if ſhe doth not, then in receiving Churches which differ in their Profeſſion, ſhe receives into her Communion ſome that are no true Churches; which I doubt will go as far towards the unchurching her, as the Profeſſion of moſt Errors whatſoever: In ſhort therefore, if not to err in its Profeſſion in any matter, be a Note of the true
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:104627:111"/>Church, all true Churches muſt neceſſarily partake of it, and conſequently none can be true Churches, which, in any point whatſoever, profeſs erroneouſly: which, as I have proved, is utterly falſe; and which, if it were true, would perhaps as much damnify the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Opinion of any ſober and honeſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer, as any one Church now extant in the World.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Secondly, Every true Note ought to be proper and peculiar to that kind of things of which it is a Note, and not common to things of another kind, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it is impoſſible that it ſhould truly diſtinguiſh the one from the other: But this Note of not erring in its Profeſſion is not peculiar to true Churches; for ſeeing there may be a Schiſm without any Error in Faith, or Hereſy, we muſt either allow Schiſmatical Societies of Chriſtians to be true Churches, (which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be ſure will never admit) or that it is by no means peculiar to true Churches not to err in their Faith. That which may be common to Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Communions with the true Church, cannot be peculiar to the true Church, ſuppoſing Schiſmatical Communions not to be the true Church, or the true parts of the true Church: but the Cardinal himſelf owns that there have been Schiſms which did not err, in their Faith, and yet were without the true Church; for ſo in his forecited Cap. 2. <hi>There may be Doctrine pure,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>from all Error in a falſe Church; for ſo pure Schiſmaticks, as heretofore the Luciferians and Donatiſts, had in the beginning very ſound Doctrine among 'em, and yet were without the true Church:</hi> Where, by the way, it's evident the good Man had quite forgot that Sanctity of Doctrine was hereafter to be one of his Notes of the true Church; for if (as he tells us in this very Chapter) the Notes of the true Church are ſuch as are proper
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:104627:112"/>and peculiar to it, it's plain that his Memory fail'd him, either when he made Sanctity of Doctrine to be one of theſe Notes, or when he allowed this Note to be common to falſe Churches with the true: Seeing therefore there have been Communities of Chriſtians in the World which have not err'd in their Faith, and yet were neither the true Church, nor any true parts of it; and ſeeing what hath been may be again, how is it poſſible for any honeſt Enquirer after the true Church, to find any one Church in the World, to which this Note of not erring is proper and peculiar? The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks did not err in their Faith, the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciferians</hi> did not err in theirs; how then is it poſſible to diſcover by this Note of not erring in Faith, which of the three were the true Church? ſeeing that that can be no true Note of the true Church which is not pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to it, and that not erring in Faith was common to 'em both.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Every true Note ought to be more known than the thing which it notifies: for how can we know a thing by that which is as unknown to us as the thing it ſelf? If therefore not to err in any point whatſoever, be a true Note of the true Church, the truth of every Article comprized in the Profeſſion of that which is the true Church, muſt be more known, than that it is the true Church; which, conſidering how very large and extenſive the publick Profeſſions of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches now are, cannot be ſuppoſed, without making the true Church to be one of the darkeſt and obſcureſt things in the World. For beſides that, according to the Principle of the Cardinal and his Church, it is the true Church only can fully inſtruct a Man in the truth of all thoſe Points of which the unerring Profeſſion of the true Church conſiſts; and therefore a Man muſt
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:104627:112"/>have found the true Church, and been inſtructed by it, before he can be certain that thoſe Points are all true, of which more hereafter: Beſides which, I ſay, it is to be conſidered, that there are ſundry Doctrines now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by moſt Churches, of which ordinary Capacities can make no certain Judgment. I confeſs, if the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Profeſſions of the Churches now in being were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the Fundamental Articles of Religion, it were an eaſy matter for an ordinary Enquirer to ſatisfy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf concerning the truth of 'em; becauſe whatſoever is fundamental is ſo plainly revealed, that probity of Mind, together with ſound Intellectuals, are the only Accompliſhments that are requiſite to Mens attainment of the knowledg of it: but ſeeing the generality of the publick Profeſſions of Churches do, together with ſuch Doctrines as are fundamental, comprehend ſuch as are not, yea, and ſometimes ſuch as are very remote from Fundamentals; and ſeeing many of theſe are not ſo plainly revealed, but that <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> they are involved with ſuch difficulties as have perplexed even the moſt learned and judicious Enquirers; to ſatisfy one's ſelf fully that ſuch Profeſſions as theſe, are in all points true, without the leaſt intermixture of Error, requires great Sagacity as well as Probity of Mind: For there is ſcarce any one Church now extant in the World, but what profeſſes ſome Doctrines which in ſome other Churches are hotly controverted and oppoſed; and ſeeing there are ſundry Churches in the World, which in ſundry Points profeſs contrary to one another, and there are ſcarce any two Churches which in all Points are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, it is certain that a great part of 'em muſt in one Point or other be erroneous; and ſeeing the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth in ſeveral Articles differ from all other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the World; either ſhe by this Note muſt be a
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:104627:113"/>falſe Church, or there is no true Church in the World but her ſelf. Now in the midſt of ſuch a vaſt multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Profeſſions, how is it poſſible for an ordinary Enquirer to conclude with any certainty, which of 'em is true, and which falſe? eſpecially conſidering that as to ſome of the Points in which they differ, there are ſuch fair probabilities <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> as are ſufficient to ſuſpend any modeſt Judgment from determining it ſelf one way or other: And that others of 'em depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch Scholaſtical Niceties, and are defended and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by ſuch ſubtile and metaphyſical Reaſonings, ſuch critical Senſes of Texts and ambiguous Accounts of Eccleſiaſtical Antiquity, as that ſcarce one Man in a thouſand is capable of making any certain judgment concerning them. If therefore, before I can conclude, that this or that is a true Church, it muſt be more known and evident to me, that it doth not err in any Point whatſoever, than that it is a true Church; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to determine which is the true Church, is one of the moſt obſcure and difficult Points in the World, and I muſt be a very learned and judicious Divine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I can modeſtly pretend to have found it: To what a miſerable uncertainty then are Mankind abandoned, when 'tis as much as their Souls are worth to be in the true Church, and yet are left to ſeek it by ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate Note as this, whereby ſcarce one Man in a thouſand is capable of finding it!</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And Laſtly, Every true Note ought to be inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the Thing which it notifies; for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can notify or make known a Thing without which the Thing may be what it is; and if that which is the Note of it may be ſeparated from it, it may be the very ſame Thing which it is, tho it hath not that Note. If therefore this Note of an unerring Profeſſion be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:104627:113"/>from the true Church, it may be the true Church, tho it be not unerring in its Profeſſion. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, before I can be certain that any Church which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be the true Church, is the true Church; I muſt be certain that this Note of not erring is inſeparable to it: But before I can be certain that this Note is inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to any one Church now extant, I muſt be certain not only that it doth not err now (which, as I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above, the generality of Men can never be) but alſo that it never hath erred, nor ever will: for, as the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal hath ſtated the matter, the thing of which we are to enquire, is not which of the Churches now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant are true Churches, or parts of the Catholick Church, but which of 'em are the true Catholick Church. If we were only to enquire which of 'em are true parts of the Catholick Church, all that we had to do, was to ſatisfy our ſelves which of 'em at preſent have the true Notes of a true part of the Catholick Church; but as for parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches, it is agreed of all hands that they may be true parts of the Catholick Church at one time, and yet not be ſo at another; ſo that as to particular Churches, all that I need to enquire is only this, Whether at preſent they are true Churches, or, which is the ſame thing, whether they have at preſent the true Notes of true Churches? But if I enquire (as the Cardinal doth) which of all the Churches now extant is the true Catholick Church; before I can be fully reſolved, I muſt not only be ſatisfied which of 'em is a true Church at preſent, but alſo which of them ſhall always continue ſo: becauſe tho particular Churches may ceaſe to be true Churches, yet the Catholick Church cannot, it being founded on that promiſe of our Saviour, that <hi>the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi> And therefore, before I can be ſecure of any preſent Church that it is the true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:104627:114"/>I muſt have ſome certainty not only that it hath not erred for the time paſt, and that it doth not err at preſent, but alſo that it will not err for the time to come; for ſeeing the true Catholick Church is always to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, if not to err in its profeſſion be a true Note of it, it muſt always be inſeparable to it, as well for the time to come, as for the time paſt and preſent. And therefore before I can be certain of any Church now extant, that it is the only true Catholick Church, by this Note of an uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Profeſſion, I ought to have very good aſſurance that it is inſeparable to it, not only for the time paſt, and preſent, but alſo for the time to come. But that it is poſſible for a Church which doth not err now, and did not err heretofore, to err hereafter, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot deny; becauſe ſhe allows no Church now extant, not to err, but her ſelf, and yet owns that there are many Churches now in being, which once did not err, and for ſeveral Ages continued untainted with Error, which yet have erred ſince, and therefore are now no true Churches; and therefore ſeeing that in the Nature of the Thing it is no more impoſſible that a Church which doth not err now, may have erred heretofore, and may err again hereafter, than that a Church which errs now, may not have erred heretofore, and may not err again hereafter, I cannot conclude of any Church that becauſe it doth not err at preſent, therefore it never hath erred, nor ever will. Suppoſe then, that there were only two Churches in the World, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> and that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church at preſent doth not err, and the <hi>Greek</hi> doth; I can from hence no more conclude, that not erring is inſeparable to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, than that erring is inſeparable to the <hi>Greek.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Church doth not err now, what then? neither did the <hi>Greek</hi> Church err once; why then may not the <hi>Greek</hi> as well be the true
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:104627:114"/>Church, becauſe once it did not err, as the <hi>Roman,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe now it doth not? Seeing that not to have erred heretofore, and not to err now, are only different Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects of the ſame thing to different Times, and that the not erring at one Time doth no more notify the true Church, than the not erring at another; it is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſufficient to notify either to be the true Church, that this Note belonged to it at ſuch or ſuch a time, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the time paſt or the time preſent, ſeeing one time or other it hath belonged to 'em both, but that of the two muſt be the true Church to which it always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, and from which it was never ſeperated. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I can pretend to be certain that it always belonged to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I muſt have peruſed the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Church, through all times paſt to the preſent Moment: But alas, thoſe Hiſtories, as the Learned of all ſides confeſs, are ſome of 'em ſo ſhort and imperfect, others ſo partial and inſincere, and others ſo repugnant and contradictory to one another, that ſuppoſing there were ſome Church now in being that never erred, and that Church were the <hi>Roman,</hi> it is next to impoſſible for me to be certain of it; for even in the Hiſtories of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which pretends to be the only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring Church, there are ſo many (at leaſt ſeeming) Contradictions of one Pope and General Council to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that it is impoſſible for any Man, who is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſt with a ſtrong Opinion of her Infallibility, to pronounce with any degree of certainty, that ſhe never erred. And methinks 'tis ſomething hard that I muſt ſeek the true Church by ſuch a Note, whereby it will be impoſſible for me to find it, without ſpending a great part of my Life in laborious reſearches of Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory; wherein after all, in ſeeking after a Church that never erred, I doubt I ſhall but ſeek for a Needle in a Bottle of Hay.</p>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:104627:115"/>
                     <p>But ſuppoſe I were ſo far ſatisfied of the Roman Church, as to believe that it neither hath err'd for the time paſt, nor doth err at the preſent. Before I can be certain that this Note is inſeparable to her, I muſt have very good aſſurance that ſhe will not err for the time to come; and by what Argument can you aſſure me of that? Why, hath not our Saviour promiſed that the Gates of Hell ſhall never prevail againſt his true Church? And doth not this neceſſarily imply that his true Church ſhall never err? Suppoſe it doth; you ought to conſider that I am now enquiring, whether the <hi>Roman</hi> Church be the true Church, or no? and conſequently, whether this Promiſe belong to her, or no? and therefore as yet, neither this, nor any other Promiſe can be a ſufficient Evidence to me, that this Note of not erring is inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to her for the future. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but that there are ſeveral Churches now extant in the World, which for ſeveral Ages did not err, &amp; yet now are erroneous; and therefore ſuppoſing that ſhe hath not erred for theſe 1600 Years paſt, how can I thence conclude that ſhe will not err hereafter? when ſhe her ſelf owns, that there are Churches now in being, which for 8 or 900 Years did not err, and yet have erred ever ſince? And what Reaſon can you give, why it ſhould be more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a Church to err after 1600 Years profeſſion of the Truth, than after 900? Wherefore, before I can be certain that this Note of not erring is inſeparable to any one Church now in being, I muſt have very good aſſurance not only that ſhe doth not err at preſent, nor ever did, but alſo that ſhe never will. But before I can be certain that ſhe neither doth err, nor ever did, I muſt be next to infallible my ſelf, and before I can be certain that ſhe never will, I muſt be certain that ſhe is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe if her not erring for the future be a Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:104627:115"/>that may or may not be, I can never be certain whether it will be or no. But it is impoſſible I ſhould be ſure that ſhe is an infallible Church, before I am ſure that ſhe is the true Church; becauſe if Infallibility be granted to any Church, it is agreed of all ſides that it is only to the true Church: And therefore I muſt be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain which is the true Church, before I can be aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed which Church is infallible. Seeing therefore, that every true Note is inſeparable to the Thing which it notifies; before I can be certain that I have found the true Church, which Chriſt hath promiſed to continue to the end of the World, by this Note of not erring, I muſt have very good aſſurance, not only that my Church doth not err at preſent, but alſo that not to err is always inſeparable to it, both for the time paſt, and the time to come: Seeing therefore there is no one Church now in being, of which we can be rationally aſſured as to this matter, the neceſſary Conſequence is, that by this Note no Man can certainly diſcover which is the true Church. And now, having proved that according to the true Properties of the Notes of the true Church, this of <hi>Sanctity of Doctrine,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> explains it, is no true Note for an honeſt Enquirer to ſeek the true Church by, I proceed,</p>
                     <p n="3">III. To enquire in what Senſe this is a true Note of the true Church. In ſhort, if by Sanctity of Doctrine, we underſtand profeſſing all the neceſſary and eſſential Articles of Chriſtian Faith, and admitting all the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial parts of Chriſtian Worſhip and Diſcipline, this wherever it is, is a certain Note of a true Church: for nothing can be a certain Note of a true Church, but what is eſſential to it as a true Church: for whatſoever
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:104627:116"/>is accidental to it, is ſeparable from it, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is ſeparable from it, it may have, or not have, and yet be a true Church; notwithſtanding that therefore which doth not appertain to it, as it is a true Church, may appertain to a falſe Church, as well as a true: But to ſay that that is not a true Church, which hath all the eſſentials of a true Church, is a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Contradiction. If therefore we would have ſuch Notes of a true Church, as we may certainly depend upon, we muſt fetch 'em from the Eſſence of a true Church; and conſequently we muſt firſt ſtate what a true Church is, before we can be certain what are the true Notes of it. Now what it is that is neceſſary to conſtitute a true Chriſtian Church, may be eaſily collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by conſidering what is neceſſary to make a true Chriſtian; for a true Chriſtian Church, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a Society of true Chriſtians. And ſeeing that Chriſtianity conſiſts of Doctrines of Faith, and Laws of Worſhip and Diſcipline, he only is a true Chriſtian that owns and receives Chriſtianity in all theſe parts of it; that is, who acknowledges all the Eſſentials of true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, Worſhip and Diſcipline. And conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that muſt be a true Chriſtian Church, or Society of true Chriſtians, which profeſſes all the Eſſential Articles of Chriſtian Faith, and receives all the Eſſential parts of Chriſtian Worſhip and Diſcipline: whereever therefore I find a Religious Society of Men profeſſing all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Doctrines of true Chriſtian Faith, worſhiping the one God, through the one Mediator, communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the true Chriſtian Sacraments, and ſubmitting to the true Chriſtian Diſcipline, duly adminiſtred by true Chriſtian Paſtors and Governours; there I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain I have found a true Church, if that be a true Church
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:104627:116"/>which hath all the Eſſentials that conſtitute a true Church. Wherefore before we can know whether this or that be a true Church, we muſt be rightly imformed what a true Church is; and before we can ſtate what a true Church is, we muſt learn what the true Faith, and Worſhip, and Diſcipline is; becauſe theſe are the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Ingredients of which a true Church is compoſed. And when we have learn'd what theſe are, by them we may certainly diſcover whether this or that be a true Church or no. If therefore by Sanctity of Doctrine, we underſtand the publick profeſſion and admiſſion of all the Eſſentials of Chriſtian Faith, Worſhip, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline; it is not only a certain Note of a true Church, but the only certain Note of it: becauſe there can be no certain Note of a true Church, but what is Eſſential to it, and there is nothing Eſſential to it, but what this Note comprehends. Where-ever this is, there is the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Eſſence of a true Church; and if there were but one Church upon Earth that had it, that would be the only true Church in the World; and if there were ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Churches agreeing in it, there would be ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand true Churches. So that whereas all other Notes are ſeparable from a true Church, and conſequently, may direct us to a falſe Church, inſtead of a true; this is no more ſeparable from it, than a true Man is from the Human Nature: And if I had found a Church, that hath in it all the other Notes of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> excepting this, I ſhould ſtill be to ſeek for a true Church; as on the contrary, if I had found a Church that wants all the reſt but this, I ſhould nevertheleſs ſit down fully ſatisfied of its Truth, and ſeek no further.</p>
                     <p>And thus I have given a brief Account, in what Senſe Sanctity of Doctrine is a certain Note of the true Church,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:104627:117"/>and by this our Church is willing to be tryed by any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and ingenuous Enquirer, whoſe Buſineſs it is to ſeek for Truth, and not for Gain and Preferment; and if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Examination, he cannot find in it (as I am ſure he may if he examine fairly) all the Eſſentials of that Faith, and Worſhip, and Diſcipline which the Scripture teaches, and the Primitive Ages profeſs'd, and embraced, in God's Name, let him ſeek farther abroad; but if after he hath miſſed of it in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he ſhould happen to find it in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> imports him as much as his Soul is worth to enquire into one Point more, <hi>viz.</hi> whether he ſought it by his Reaſon, or by his Intereſt. And now I proceed,</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. And Laſtly, To ſhew, That according to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the true Church is not to be found by this Note, in which-ſoever of the two Senſes we underſtand it: for if by Sanctity of Doctrine we mean with <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> an unerring profeſſion of the Truth, without any the leaſt intermixture of Error, before we can be certain we have found the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> true Church by it, we muſt be very well aſſured concerning the profeſſion of that Church, which we take to be the true Church, that it is in all particulars true, without any the leaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient of Error: Or if, by Sanctity of Doctrine, we only mean the profeſſion of all the Eſſentials of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith, Worſhip, and Diſcipline, before we can be certain that we have found the true Church by it, we muſt be very well aſſured, not only that there are ſuch Eſſential Principles, and what they are, but alſo that they are true; for unleſs we certainly know that there are ſuch Principles, and what they are, we can never be certain whether any one Church in the World doth
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:104627:117"/>profeſs 'em or no: for how can we know whether or no a Church profeſſes we know not what? And unleſs we certainly know that theſe Principles are true, we can never be certain whether that be a true Church which profeſſes 'em; for ſeeing it is the profeſſion of the true Principles of Religion that makes a true Church, it is impoſſible for us to know whether any Church be a true Church, till we know whether the Principles it profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are true. So that before a Man can be ſecure that he hath found the true Church, by this Note, he muſt be certain either that every thing it profeſſes is true, or at leaſt that the main and fundamental Principles of its Profeſſion are true: Neither of which he can be certain of according to the Principles of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> She decries Mens private Judgment of Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as utterly inſufficient to make any certain diſtinction of Truth from Falſhood in matters of Religion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> She allows no ſufficient Rule, without the true Church, to guide and direct our private Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Diſcretion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> She reſolves all Certainty, as to matters of Faith, into the Authority of the true Church.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> She authorizes the true Church to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon us an abſolute neceſſity of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Things, as before were not neceſſary to be believed.</p>
                     <pb n="194" facs="tcp:104627:118"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> decries Men's private Judgment of Diſcretion, as utterly inſufficient to make any certain diſtinction of Truth from Falſhood, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion. Seeing we are to ſeek the true Church by Notes, our certainty that we have found it, muſt wholly depend upon our certainty that we have found in it the Notes of the true Church: but tho there is no one thing in the World of which we are more concerned to be certain, than that we have found the true Church, and are in Communion with it, becauſe no leſs than our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Salvation depends upon it; yet it is only our own private Judgment of Diſcretion, that by applying the Notes of the true Church, can aſcertain us in this Point: For while we are in queſt of the true Church, we have no other way to find it, but by carrying the Notes of it along with us, and by examining and judging, by our own private Diſcretion, which Church theſe Notes do belong to; either our private Diſcretion is ſufficient to aſſertain us in this Matter, or it is not; if it be not, we can never be certain which is the true Church; if it be, it muſt be ſufficient to aſſertain us in all other neceſſary Points of Religion: becauſe one of the Notes by which we are to ſeek the true Church, and that a principal one too, is Sanctity of Doctrine, or an unerring profeſſion of the true Religion, at leaſt in all neceſſary points. But before we can be certain which Church this Note be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to, we muſt be throughly ſatisfied in our own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Diſcretion, what this unerring Profeſſion is, which we can never be, till we are certain of the Truth of all the Particulars of it, and when we are certain of this, we are certain at leaſt as to all neceſſary points of true Religion, which muſt all be included in every unerring
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:104627:118"/>Profeſſion of it. So that before we can be certain of any Church, that it is the true Church, we muſt be certain that it doth not err in its profeſſion; and before we can be certain of this, we muſt be certain of the Truth of all thoſe particular Doctrines whereof its Profeſſion is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; and of this we have as yet no other way to be certain, but only by our own private Judgment of Diſcretion; becauſe till we have found the true Church, its impoſſible we ſhould conduct our ſelves by its Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and in the abſence of the true Churches Authority, we have nothing to conduct us but our own private Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion: either this our private Diſcretion therefore, is ſufficient to aſſertain us of the Truth of all the particular Doctrines, whereof an unerring Profeſſion of Religion is compoſed, or it is not; if it be, it muſt be ſufficient to aſſertain us as to all neceſſary points of Religion; if it be not (as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> affirms it is not) it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible we ſhould ever be certain that we have found the true Church: again either therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> muſt allow that certainty in all (at leaſt in all neceſſary) Points of Religion, is attainable by the free and honeſt uſe of our own private Judgment of Diſcretion (which, as I ſhall ſhew by and by, ſhe can never allow, without undermining her own Foundations); or ſhe muſt leave Men hovering in eternal Uncertainty, as to one of the moſt neceſſary Points of Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> which is the true Church.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> allows no ſufficient Rule, without the true Church, to guide and direct our private Judgment of Diſcretion. Seeing the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the true Church is not natural, but entirely founded upon Divine Inſtitution, this Queſtion, Which
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:104627:119"/>is the true Church? is not to be reſolved by Principles of Nature, but by Principles of Revelation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, without ſome revealed Rule, which is every way ſufficient to guide and direct our private Diſcretion, we ſhall never be able to find out which is the true Church; becauſe without ſuch a Rule we have nothing but the Principles of Nature to go by, which in this Enquiry are utterly inſufficient to direct us. But while we are out of the Church, we have no other revealed Rule to direct us in our Enquiry after it, but only that of Scripture; for as for Tradition, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teaches that the true Church is the ſole Conſervator of it, and that tho it be a part of Divine Revelation, yet no Man is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged any farther to believe it, than the true Church hath defined and declared it. And ſeeing I can have ho cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty what is a true Tradition, till ſuch time as I am got into the true Church, How can Tradition be a Rule of Faith to me, while I am out of it? Or, How can that be the Rule of my Faith, whilſt I am in queſt of the true Church, which I have no other Obligation to believe, but only the true Churches Authority? Whilſt therefore I am out of the true Church, the only Rule I have to go by, in my Enquiries after it, is Scripture: And this the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> tells me is inſufficient, both becauſe it is not full enough, and becauſe it is not clear enough. Which if true, I can never be certain I have found the true Church, by this Note of an unerring Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>1ſt.</hi> She teaches that the Scripture is not full enough, as not containing in it all neceſſary Doctrines of Faith, and Manners; but that there are certain unwritten Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Church, of equal Authority with it: by which its defects are ſupplied. And if ſo, How is it poſſible I
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:104627:119"/>ſhould find the true Church by the direction of Scripture? For ſince, according to this Note, that can be no true Church, which doth not unerringly profeſs all neceſſary Doctrines of Faith, and Manners; when I have found a Church which profeſſes all ſuch neceſſary Doctrines, as are <hi>in</hi> Scripture, I cannot be ſecure that it is a true Church, ſuppoſing there are other neceſſary Doctrines <hi>out</hi> of Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> in the unwritten Traditions; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then the profeſſion of theſe will be altogether as neceſſary to its being a true Church, as the profeſſion of thoſe. All that the Scripture can ſatisfy me in, is only this, whether ſuch a Church profeſs all the neceſſary Doctrines in Scripture? but if there are any neceſſary Doctrines out of Scripture, it's certain that the profeſſion of them is as neceſſary to the being of the true Church, as the profeſſion of thoſe that are in it. And therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I can be certain that it is the true Church, I muſt be fully ſatisfied that it profeſſeth both, which I can never be, unleſs I have ſome other Rule to go by beſides this of Scripture.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>2dly.</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teaches, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is no ſufficient Rule in reſpect of clearneſs, the Senſe of it being ſo obſcurely expreſt, that we can never be certain what it is, without the Interpretation of the true Church: Which if true, it's utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for one, who is out of the true Church, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to find it by the direction of Scripture. For according to this Note, that only is the true Church which doth not err in its Profeſſion, at leaſt in any neceſſary Point, either as to Doctrines of Faith, or Doctrines of Manners. But before I can know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any Church doth not err in its Profeſſion, I muſt be certainly informed what the true Profeſſion is,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:104627:120"/>or what are thoſe Doctrines of Faith, and Manners, of which this true Profeſſion conſiſts; as to which the Scripture can never certainly inform me, if it be not ſufficiently clear. For if I can never be certain what the true ſenſe of Scripture is, without the Interpretation of the true Church, How is it poſſible that while I am out of the true Church I ſhould ever be certain of its Senſe, as to all the particular Doctrines which the true Profeſſion of Religion contains? So that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Principle, the Scripture is ſo far from being a ſufficient Rule to one that is out of the true Church, that it is perfectly uſeleſs to him in his Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry after it: for either it can certainly direct him to the true Church, or it cannot; if it can, it muſt be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently clear to inform him of its own Senſe (without the Interpretation of the true Church); concerning all thoſe Doctrines of Faith, and Manners, whereof the unerring Profeſſion of the true Church is compoſed; and if ſo, this Principle of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; if it be not, to what purpoſe doth it ſerve, unleſs it be to lead him into an endleſs Maze of Uncertainties, wherein the further he wanders, the more he will loſe himſelf? So that if a Man hath had the misfortune to be born and bred out of the true Church, in an Heretical or Schiſmatical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and is enquiring his way <hi>in,</hi> by this Note of an unerring Profeſſion, he hath no other Rule to inſtruct and inform him, what this unerring Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is, but only that of Scripture; which according to the Principles of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for his Purpoſe. How then is it poſſible he ſhould ever be certain that he hath found the true Church, when the only Rule he hath, whereby to
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:104627:120"/>enquire what that unerring Profeſſion is where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is to ſeek it, is utterly inſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve him?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> reſolves all Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, as to matters of Faith, into the Authority of the true Church, and indeed this is the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Principle of Popery, <hi>viz.</hi> That the only ground of Certainty, as to matters of Faith, is the Authority of the preſent true Church teaching and propoſing 'em. Till ſuch time therefore as we have found the true Church, and do believe upon the Authority of its teaching, we can never have any true Certainty of the matters which we are to believe. And yet before we can be certain that we have found the true Church, by this Note of an uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Profeſſion, we muſt have very good certainty as to all matters of Faith; for we can never be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain upon the Authority of any Church, that what we believe is true, till ſuch time as we are certain that it is the true Church; nor can we ever be certain that it is the true Church, until we are certain that it doth not err in its Profeſſion; or which is the ſame thing, that all the matters of Faith, which it teaches and profeſſes, are true: So that the certainty of our Faith, after we have found the true Church, and do believe upon its Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, muſt depend upon the certainty of our Faith while we were ſeeking it, and did believe without its Authority: Becauſe before we can believe with any certainty, upon the Authority of any Church, we muſt be certain that it is the true Church; but we can never be certain that it is the true Church, till
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:104627:121"/>we are firſt certain that its Profeſſion is true, as to all the matters of Faith contained in it.</p>
                     <p>To make the matter more plain, I will briefly repreſent it in a ſhort Dialogue between a Proteſtant and a Papiſt.</p>

                        <p>But as yet I am not certain that the Church, upon whoſe Authority you would have me believe, is the true Church; and till I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of this, with what Certainty can I depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her Authority? Would you have me be certain that whatſoever ſhe profeſſes is true, upon her own bare Word and Authority, before I am certain that ſhe is the true Church? If ſo why may I not as well believe any other Church to be the true Church, ſeeing there is no other Church but what will paſs its Word for the Truth of its own Profeſſion, as well as yours? If not, you muſt allow me to have ſome other ground of Certainty, as to Matters of Faith, beſides the Authority of the true Church. For before I can ſecurely rely upon the Authority of any Church, as the true ground of Certainty, I muſt be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that it is the true Church, and my Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that ſhe is the true Church, muſt depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Certainty of the Truth of all thoſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith compriſed in her Profeſſion. So that before I am certain of the Truth of her Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:104627:122"/>it is too ſoon for me to rely upon her Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as the only ground of Certainty; and when I am certain of it, it is too late, becauſe I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain already.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly.</hi> And Laſtly, The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> gives Authority to the true Church, to impoſe upon Mens Minds a neceſſity of believing ſuch things as, before, they were not obliged to believe: For ſhe makes the Church's Authority not only a concurrent motive of Faith, but the very formal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it, ſo that we are not only obliged to believe what the Church declares, but we are therefore obliged to believe it, becauſe ſhe declares it. 'Tis true, ſome of the Roman Doctors tell us that the Church hath no power to make new Articles of Faith, but only, that ſeeing there ſome old Truths in Scripture, and the unwritten Tradition of the Church, which the Church hath not yet declared, and which therefore Men are not yet obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; the Church hath Authority when ever ſhe thinks meet to declare 'em, and thereby to oblige Men under pain of Damnation to believe 'em; but others of 'em and (particularly Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin de Poteſt. Sum. Pontif.</hi>) tell us, <hi>That the Church of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Time not only hath power to explain and declare, but alſo to Conſtitute and Command thoſe Things which belong to Faith.</hi> And indeed the difference between declaring and conſtituting, or making an Article of Faith, is only Verbal: For an Article of Faith is a Truth that is neceſſary to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And therefore, if the Church by declaring a Truth, which was not neceſſary to be believed,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:104627:123"/>makes it neceſſary to be believed, it thereby makes that Truth an Article of Faith, which was not an Article of Faith. And ſo to declare, and to make, is the very ſame thing. But in this they are all agreed, that the true Church hath power to make thoſe things neceſſary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved which were not ſo before. And if this be true, no Man can ever be certain, by this Note of an unerring Profeſſion, that he hath found the true Church. For before I can be certain of any Church (as, for inſtance, the <hi>Roman</hi>) that it is the true Church, I muſt be certain that that Church's Profeſſion is true; but when I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to examine the particular Articles of it (as I muſt do before I can be certain of the Truth of the whole) I ſhall find there are ſeveral of them, of the Truth of which in the opinion of ſeveral (even of her own Doctors) I have no ſufficient ground to be certain, either in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or Tradition (which while I am ſeeking the true Church, are the only Rule I have whereby to examine them) as particularly, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, Seven Sacraments, Neceſſity of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular Confeſſion, Roman Purgatory, and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences. <hi>Vid.</hi> Note the Sixth, <hi>pag.</hi> 125. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if theſe Roman Doctors pretend to be certain of them, upon no other Reaſon, but becauſe their Church (which they are ſure is the true Church), hath declared them. How ſhall I be certain of them, who am but an Enquirer, whether it be the true Church or no? And therefore as yet cannot be ſuppoſed to be ſure that it is; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her Declaration, they themſelves confeſs, I
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:104627:123"/>have no ſufficient ground to be certain of the Truth of them: And till I am ſure ſhe is the true Church, her Declarations are no ground of Certainty to me. And as I cannot be certain that theſe Articles are true, till I am ſure that the Church which declare them is the true Church; ſo ſuppoſing that the true Church hath power to impoſe upon me a neceſſity of believing ſuch Things, as before I was not obliged to believe, I cannot be certain that they are falſe; becauſe no Authority can be ſuppoſed to have a right to impoſe upon Men ſuch a neceſſity of believing, but what is infallible, and cannot impoſe what is falſe on them; unleſs it be ſuppoſed that Men may be rightfully obliged to believe what is falſe. If therefore the Roman Church be the true Church, (as for all I yet know it may); then for all I yet know it hath Authority from God to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon me a neceſſity of believing whatever ſhe declares; and conſequently for all I yet know ſhe is Infallible. But as for my ſelf I know that I am a fallible Creature, and therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Infallibility declares to me muſt certainly be true, whatſoever Probabilities, yea, or ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Demonſtrations I may have againſt it; how then can I be certain that any Article is falſe which is declared to me by a Church, that for all I yet know is Infallible? if it be Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I am ſure that whatever it declares is true: And if it be the true Church, it muſt be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible. Suppoſing that the true Church hath Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to impoſe new Neceſſities of believing, but whether it be the true Church or no, is
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:104627:124"/>the Thing I am now enquiring by this Note of an unerring Profeſſion? But till I am certain one way or t'other, whether ſhe be the true Church or no? I can never be certain whether her Profeſſion be true or falſe; till I am certain that ſhe is the true Church, there are ſome Articles in her Profeſſion, of which (as her own Doctors confeſs) I cannot be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that they are true; and till I am certain that ſhe is not the true Church, I can never be certain that any one Article in her Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is falſe; and if I cannot be certain whether ſhe errs in her Profeſſion or no, till I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whether ſhe be the true Church or no, to what purpoſe ſhould I enquire whether or no ſhe be the true Church, by this Note of an uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Profeſſion? If ſuppoſing her to be the true Church, ſhe hath Authority from God to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige me upon pain of Damnation to believe to Day that which I was not obliged to believe Yeſterday; to what end do I enquire whether thoſe things which ſhe commands me to believe, are true or falſe? If ſhe be the true Church, (as for all I yet know ſhe may be) I am ſure what ever ſhe commands me to believe muſt be true; and therefore till I am certain that ſhe is not the true Church, I can never be certain that any thing ſhe commands me to believe is falſe: For how can I be certain that any one thing ſhe impoſes is falſe, when for all I yet know, ſhe is the true Church, which the God of Truth (who can neither impoſe himſelf, nor authorize any other to impoſe on me that
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:104627:124"/>which is falſe) hath authorized to impoſe it? and if till I am certain that ſhe is not the true Church, I can never be certain that any thing ſhe impoſes is falſe; How can I ever be cartain, by this Note of an unerring Profeſſion, whether ſhe be the true Church or no? For if any thing ſhe profeſſes or impoſes be falſe, by this Note, ſhe cannot be the true Church; but whether any thing ſhe profeſſes be falſe or no, I can never be certain, till I am firſt certain, whether ſhe is, or is not the true Church.</p>

                     <p>BY Efficacy of Doctrine, muſt be meant either that power which the Word of God has in the Minds of Particular Men to diſpoſe them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve aright, and to live well; or elſe that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs which it has in drawing Multitudes outwardly to profeſs and embrace it. The former of theſe is too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a thing to be the Note of a true Church. No Man being able to know what the Word of God has done in anothers Heart, but inſtead of that apt rather to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in what it has done in his own.</p>
                     <p>The Second (which muſt be that the Cardinal means) can as little be a Note, by reaſon of its Uncertainty; and if we cannot be ſure of the Note, we ſhall be leſs ſo of that, which we are to find out by it. If indeed
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:104627:126"/>there were nothing which could or did move Men to relinquiſh Heatheniſm, Judaiſm or Turciſm for our Religion, but the pure Efficacy of the Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, it would be a very good Note of the excellence of the Doctrine it ſelf; but, according to the Cardinal's own Principles, it could be no Note that that were the true Church which preached it, ſince he will not allow <hi>the ſincere preaching of Truth</hi> to ſignify any thing.<note place="margin">Lib. iv. 2.</note> And we ſhall have much leſs reaſon to rely on this Note, if we conſider how many other things there are beſides the Efficacy of the Chriſtian Doctrine, which have and may convert whole Nations to it.</p>
                     <p>Let us therefore at preſent grant in general the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact to be true, that ſuch Converſions as the Cardinal ſpeaks of were made by the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> yet how ſhall we know that they were made purely by the Efficacy of its Doctrine, and that no other means, ſuch as Force, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were uſed? Is it enough that he tells us ſo? The Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> tells us, that in the late great Converſion in <hi>France,</hi> not one of the Perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <hi>ſuffered Violence, either in his Perſon or Goods; That they were ſo far from ſuffering Torments,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Paſtoral Letter <hi>p. 3, 4.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>that they had not ſo much as heard them mentioned; and that he heard other Biſhops affirm the ſame.</hi> Now if thoſe Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Prelats were out (as moſt people think they were) in a matter of Fact, of which they might be Eye-witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; why may not the learned Cardinal be ſo too in his Relation of Converſions, made ſo many hundred years ſince? If he be out, his Note falls to the ground: and if it cannot be made plainly to appear to us, that he was not out, his Note, as far as it is founded upon thoſe Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories which he produces wants that certainty, which ſhould give us ſatisfaction. Hiſtorians who wrote in thoſe obſcure times, and were perhaps themſelves Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verters,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:104627:126"/>being moſt of them Monks, might vain-glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly aſcribe much to the Efficacy of their own Doctrine; and the <hi>Centuriators</hi> themſelves, whom he ſo often quotes, might not be very curious to ſearch, or accurate to relate the chief motives of their Converſions, becauſe they wrote before the Cardinal had made <hi>Efficacy of Doctrine</hi> a Note of the true Church, and little dream't what odd uſe ſome Men would make of their Hiſtory. But notwithſtanding theſe Neglects and Diſadvantages, I do not doubt, but that if we look'd back into the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of thoſe Times, nay even into the <hi>Centuriators</hi> themſelves, we ſhould find ſome other things beſides Efficacy of Doctrine concurring to the Converſions which were then wrought. An inſtance whereof (to paſs by at preſent the particular examination of thoſe mentioned by the Cardinal) we have in thoſe Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wrought by <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, to whoſe victorious Arms they were more to be aſcribed than to any thing elſe beſides. For (not to mention that the Clergy were not then in any great capacity of doing much by the Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their Doctrine, the Biſhops being ſo ignorant, that they were to be commanded to underſtand the Lord's Prayer, and could hardly be brought to make ſome few exhortations to the People, but inſtead of that turned Souldiers, to ſhew that they were willing to do ſomewhat towards the propagating their Religion) ſuch was the Zeal of that Prince rather to <hi>defend and increaſe the Kingdom of Jeſus Christ,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mezeray in the Life of Charles the Great.</note> 
                        <hi>than to inlarge his own Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; that Peace could never be obtained of him upon other ther Terms, than that thoſe who were conquered by him, having left their Idol-worſhip, ſhould embrace the true,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Krantzius Praef. ad Metrop.</note> 
                        <hi>ſincere and eternal Religion of Chriſt.</hi> And to engage them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue firm to it, he ſometimes took Hoſtages of them, and finding them begin to apoſtatize (which they as
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:104627:127"/>often did, as they thought themſelves able to make head againſt their Conquerors) he was forc'd to ſet up a kind of Inquiſition to keep them in aw, which <hi>Mezeray</hi> tells us laſted in <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> till the 15th Century. Now when the Swords of victorious Princes, as it happened in this caſe, had made way for the preaching of the Goſpel; when the receiving of it was often made one of the Terms they who were conquered muſt neceſſarily ſubmit to, the Monks had very eaſy work; what-ever Doctrine they had preached might have been efficacious under ſuch Circumſtances. So that when there is with the Chriſtian Doctrine a concurrence of many other things which have ſo ſtrong an influence upon humane Nature, 'tis hard, nay impoſſible for us to know which of them does the work. When different Medicines proper for the ſame Diſtemper are adminiſtred at the ſame time, 'tis not eaſy to ſay which of them works the Cure.</p>
                     <p>There is indeed a wonderful Efficacy in the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Doctrine: but we can never be ſure that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of a Nation is effected by that, when Hopes, and Fears, and outward Force, and neceſſity are in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with it.</p>
                     <p>All which is ſo far from detracting from the honour of our Religion, and the Converſions it made in the Primitive Times, that it ſets i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> it a better Light, and makes it ſhine the brighter. Men were converted then, not to a conquering, but perſecuted Church. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Power was againſt them that preached this holy Doctrine: Much might be loſt, and nothing in this World got by it. There were no rewards to encourage Men to receive it, but a thouſand Difficulties and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to deter them from it. And then indeed the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of the Chriſtian Doctrine was in its greateſt luſtre;
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:104627:127"/>it wrought all alone, and had nothing to put in with it for a ſhare in the Conqueſts it made: The ſimplicity of its Preachers cleared them from all ſuſpicion of Fraud. The little or no Intereſt they had in the Government, makes it plain, that they could not uſe force; and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing concurred to demonſtrate that 'twas purely the Efficacy of their Doctrine by which they prevailed. But, to proceed a little more particularly to anſwer what the Cardinal has diſcourſed upon this Subject,</p>
                     <p>

Altho our Saviour ſufficiently underſtood how much his Doctrine was likely to prevail in the World, yet he is ſo far from making this to be a Note of his Church, that he gives as plain intimations of the Prevalency of Error, and does often bid us take care how we are impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

He does indeed compare the preaching of his Goſpel to a <hi>grain of Muſtard-ſeed, which is the leaſt of all Seeds, hut when it is grown, it is the greateſt among Herbs, unto Leaven which leaveneth the whole Lump; unto a Net which gathereth of every kind.</hi> All which Compariſons do intimate how much his Church would ſpread far &amp; near: but not that ſuch its diffuſiveneſs was to be relied upon as a Note whereby to find it; for by that Mark it could not then have been found when it was but a little Flock. Beſides that, in the ſame Chapter, he compares likewiſe the preaching of his Goſpel <hi>to a Man which ſowed good Seed in his Field;</hi>

He compares likewiſe the Miniſters of his Word, to the Servants of a certain King, ſent out by him to call thoſe that were bidden to the Wedding, but to no purpoſe,<note place="margin">Mat. 22.2. &amp;c.</note> 
                        <hi>for they all made light of it.</hi> Intimating here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, how poſſible it is for thoſe who are obſtinate not to hearken to the moſt efficacious Doctrine that can be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, the moſt paſſionate and earneſt invitations which can be made them. And in the Parable of the good Seed, ſome of which fell by the way-ſide, ſome upon
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:104627:128"/>ſtony places, ſome among Thorns,<note place="margin">Mat. 13.3, 4.</note> and other upon good Ground; He does plainly ſet forth, that let any Doctrine be never ſo good, the reception which it finds in the World, will be no other than what is agreeable to thoſe Diſpoſitions of mind which it happens to meet with. And here alſo, if the Rule had been, that that is the true Doctrine which grows faſteſt and out-tops the other, we muſt have given it for the Thorns, which grew up and choaked the good Seed. Which leads me to ſhew,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From the conſideration of the Temper and conſtitution of Mankind, how weak a proof of a true Church, the prevalency of any Doctrine is which it teacheth. For Mens minds are ſo uncertain, by reaſon of the Inconſtancy of their Circumſtances, which chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly influence them, that often Truth is ſhut out, where Error finds an eaſy admiſſion. Humane Nature is ſo weak a thing, ſo apt to take impreſſions, firſt from this thing, then from another, that no great heed is to be given to its changes; no certain Argument can be drawn from them. Such indeed is the Power of Truth, that were Mankind freed from their Prejudices againſt it, were their Minds no way byaſſed by Intereſt or Paſſion, and at the ſame time fully inſtructed concerning it, there is no doubt to be made, but that it would generally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. But when Mens Inclinations and Circumſtances are ſo various, nothing is more manifeſt, than that the receiving, or rejecting Truth, is a thing too uncertain to be made an infallible Note of it. When it is argued on behalf of Chriſtianity, that ſo many thouſands were on the ſuddain converted to the Faith: the force of ſuch an Argument does not lie in the bare prevalency of the Doctrine, but in its prevalency when placed in ſuch Circumſtances as it at the firſt preaching of the Goſpel was; and when Men of mean birth and education (as
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:104627:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>has already been obſerved) did without force or fraud on the ſuddain make ſo many proſelytes to a Religion, which was ſo directly contrary to thoſe Opinions to which the World had been ſo long accuſtomed, a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which was likely to bring ſuch great Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon thoſe who embraced it: This indeed was very remarkable, and could be aſcribed to nothing but the Power of Truth, which was only able to bring about ſo wonderful an Effect. In a word, Men being oftner guided by Fancy, Prejudice, and Intereſt, than by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon makes them more capable of Error than of Truth; and when they have once received it, not only unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to part with it, but zealous to propagate it as much as they can. The Agreeableneſs of any Doctrine to their wicked Luſts and Affections, is moſt likely to win upon them. The craft and cunning of thoſe who lie in wait to deceive, may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap>. Force, the enjoyment of preſent Preferment, or the hopes of it, may make them profeſs what they do not believe to be true, and then ſeek for Reaſons to defend it. Since then there are ſo many things beſide Truth, which may induce Men to admit any Doctrine, the bare admitting of it, tho never ſo univerſally, can be no Note of the Truth of that, or of the Church that teaches it. God has endued us with a capacity of finding out Truth, but at the ſame time he has made us fallible Creatures, and liable to be impoſed upon; ſo that it ſtands us in hand to be aware, how we are deceived; and the more care we take in a concern of this Nature, the more we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover our own Sincerity and Zeal for Truth. But let there be never ſuch clear Diſcoveries thereof, it is in our power wilfully to ſhut our Eyes againſt them; nay when we have adhered to Truth for ſome time, we may
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:104627:129"/>be tempted either wholly to forſake it, or to intermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle groſs Errors with it. So that it is as improper to conclude the prevalency of any Doctrine to be an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Truth of it, or of the Church that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it; as that any Cauſe is juſt becauſe ſucceſsful. Such is God's infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs, that as he does oftentimes bleſs with unexpected Succeſs an honeſt and juſt Deſign, and they who are ſagacious in tracing the Footſteps of Providence, do eaſily diſcover it; ſo does he likewiſe frequently exert his Power after an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manner for the propagation of Truth. But on the other hand, as he often permits an unjuſt Deſign to prevail and proſper, ſo likewiſe does he ſuffer Error to multiply and increaſe. And when he does at any time exert his Power after an extraordinary manner, for the propagation of Truth, he ſtill deals with Men as with Rational Creatures; ſo that ſuch his Power may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, nay, may be ſo far reſiſted, as may make him pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh with Infatuation ſuch their Reſiſtance; as he ſerved the Phariſees upon the account of their Obſtinacy, <hi>whoſe Eyes he blinded, and whoſe Heart he hardned,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John 12.40, 41.</note> 
                        <hi>that they ſhould not ſee with their Eyes, nor underſtand with their Heart, and be converted.</hi> And as happened to thoſe whom the Apoſtle makes mention of, whom becauſe <hi>they received not the love of Truth that they might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi>

                        <hi>God ſent ſtrong Deluſions, that they might believe a Lie.</hi> Since therefore ſuch is the Temper and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Mankind, as to be daily ſubject to Errors, and to be liable, by the juſt Judgment of God, to be at laſt hardened in them, nothing can with any certainty be determined concerning the Truth of any Church from the Prevalency of any Doctrine profeſſed in it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Plain Matter of Fact ſhews the Inſufficiency of this Note. For the Hiſtories of all Ages make it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:104627:130"/>what an influence Error has often had upon Mens Minds; and that altho Truth may have happened ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to have prevailed, yet that it has been as often refuſed, and groſs and moſt impious Opinions preferr'd before it. How ſoon were our firſt Parents, when their Minds were in their greateſt ſtrength and vigor, and not as yet biaſſed by any Miſapprehenſions of things,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.5, 6.</note> by the cunning Artifices of Satan tempted to believe a Lie?

Yet how ſoon did they forget God, and turned after Idols? So that in the time of <hi>Ahab,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to God's own account, there were but 7000 who had not bowed unto <hi>Baal.</hi> If the Efficacy of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine had been a Note of the true Church, I do not ſee why the Prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> had not as much reaſon at that time to have inſiſted upon it, as the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts can have now. At our Saviour's coming the <hi>Phariſees</hi> had infected the whole Nation with their Traditions, and ſo obſtinately did they adhere to them, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the many Miracles which our Saviour had wrought for them, notwithſtanding the Holineſs of his Life and Converſation, few believed on him, according to the Propheſy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> made mention <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.38. <hi>Lord, who hath believed our Report?</hi> of which our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf complains <hi>John</hi> 5.43. <hi>I am come in my Father's Name, And ye receive me not: if another ſhall come in his own Name, him ye will receive.</hi> And in the 11th of St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi>

If any Doctrine was likely to have been efficacious, one would have thought the Doctrine of our Saviour, when taught by himſelf, had been ſo; and yet we find that no Prophet was ever leſs reſpected than he was, even among his own Country-men. The ſame thing happened likewiſe to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as we read, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.45. and <hi>Act.</hi> 28.24, &amp;c. After Chriſtianity had for above 300 Years been ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to get ground in the World, how ſtrangely did Arianiſm on the ſudden prevail againſt it? One would have thought, that after People had for ſome time been confirmed in the Truth, they ſhould not have been ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily tempted to embrace ſo groſs an Error.

As to this Particular the Cardinal urgeth that Mahumetaniſm is propagated by Force of Arms, and not by the Efficacy of its Doctrine. In anſwer to which Aſſertion, (beſides that the World is not ignorant how little reaſon the Cardinal had to make this Objection, and that <hi>Mahomet</hi> muſt have firſt converted thoſe by his Doctrine, whom he afterwards made uſe of to convert others by Force) I ſhall ſet down this remarkable Inſtance, whereby it will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly appear how much the Mahometan Miſſionaries, even without the aſſiſtance of any outward Force, may ſometimes prove too hard for the <hi>Roman</hi> Ones. <hi>Bati</hi> King of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> having waſted the Chriſtian Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, returns into <hi>Scythia,</hi> leaving all <hi>Europe</hi> in a great Conſternation. Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the 4th in the Year 1246, from the Council of <hi>Lions,</hi> ſends a company of Religious Men a long Journey to him, to exhort him to worſhip the one living and true God, and his only Son Jeſus Chriſt, the Saviour of the World, and to abſtain from ſhedding Chriſtian Blood. When the <hi>Tartar</hi> had heard the Pope's Requeſt, he promiſed for five Years not to trouble the Chriſtians.<note place="margin">Laur. Surii Comment. <hi>p.</hi> 25.</note> But as ſoon as the Pope's Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers were gone, ſome <hi>Saracens</hi> came exhorting the <hi>Tartars</hi> to embrace the Mahometan Sect rather than
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:104627:131"/>Chriſtianity, and what they ſaid had ſuch Effect, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon the Emperour, that they embrac'd Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taniſm, and keep to it ſtill. In this caſe the two Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines had very fair play; for the <hi>Tartars</hi> were preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd on neither ſide, neither could any Force be made uſe of to compel them to receive one Doctrine more than the other. If either had the advantage, it was that of the Romiſh Church; for that had got the ſtart, but was ſoon wholly rejected; and the other has ever ſince been embraced.</p>
                     <p>Were not thoſe Inſtances which I have mention'd ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſhew what little Judgment can be made of the Truth of any Church from the Reception which its Doctrine has met with in the World, I might here add the Converſions wrought by thoſe of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, whom the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> accounts Hereticks. <hi>Frumentius,</hi> ſent by <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> converted the <hi>Indians; Moyſes,</hi> an <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Monk, the <hi>Saracens.</hi> And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Converſion of the <hi>Moſcovites, Paulus Jovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> thus ſpeaks: <hi>Above five hundred Years ſince,</hi> ſays he,<note place="margin">De Legatione Moſcovit.</note> 
                        <hi>the Moſcovites worſhip'd the Heathen Gods,</hi> Jupiter, &amp;c. <hi>but then were they firſt initiated in the Chriſtian Rites, when the Greek Biſhops out of an inconſtant temper began to diſſent from the Latin Church, and it ſo happened, that the Moſcovites in the ſame ſenſe, and with a moſt hearty Belief followed thoſe Religions Rites which they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from their Greek Teachers.</hi> I might likewiſe make mention of the great Efficacy of the Reformed Doctrine, which in the ſpace of fifty Years, when Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> ſet out the Defence of his Apology, notwithſtanding the great Oppoſition which had been made againſt it, had over-run whole Nations,<note place="margin">Defence of Apol. <hi>p. 36.</hi>

If the Doctrine which they who are converted have received, be a true Doctrine, this indeed is a good Note of a true Church, and we are willing to ſtand and fall by it; but their bare Converſion is no Note at all, becauſe as to its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received, or not received, Error has had the ſame fate in the World as Truth it ſelf has had. And of this the Cardinal himſelf was enough ſenſible, who having forgot what he had made to be the ninth Note of the Church, does repeat in an Oration at the end of his Controverſies this Objection of the Reformiſts: <hi>How is it poſſible (ſay they) that that Doctrine ſhould not be from God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Orat. in Scholis habita. edit. In. 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Ingolſt.</hi> 1593.</note> 
                        <hi>which in ſo ſhort time has over-run ſo many People, Provinces, and Kingdoms?</hi> And then makes this Anſwer, <hi>If it be lawful to philoſophiſe after this manner, we ſhall have much more reaſon to wonder why the Alcoran of Mahomet in ſo great a part of the World has ſo eaſily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having thus in the general ſhewn that Efficacy of Doctrine can be no Note of a true Church, it neceſſarily follows, that the Efficacy of the Doctrine profeſſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> can be no Note of its being ſo. But yet, that I may further ſhew what little reaſon that Church of all others has to pretend that it is the Character of its being a true Church; I deſire in the ſecond place, that theſe following Particulars may be conſidered.</p>
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:104627:132" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <p n="1">1. That altho we charge the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with many Errors and Miſtakes, yet we allow it to contain in it a mixture of Truth. Now this very mixture of Truth may perhaps be of ſufficient force to make Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes; but then it does not follow, but that ſuch Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes may likewiſe have embraced the Errors which are mixed with it, as well as the Truth it ſelf. The <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> (whoſe Converſion to the Romiſh Faith I ſhall ſpeak of afterwards) were not ſo void of Reaſon, but that if they compared the Religion of their Conquerors with their own Worſhip, they might be perſwaded to embrace the former, rather than adhere ſtill to the latter. And altho by this means they were but half converted to the Truth, yet it was better that it ſhould be thus, than that they ſhould not have been converted at all; for by this means they were much nearer the reception of the whole Truth than they were formerly, which was a great advantage; and therefore we reckon thoſe but an ill ſort of Proteſtants, who would rather have Men Turks and Infidels than of the Romiſh Church. But at the ſame time the Converſion of never ſo many to Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is no Argument of its not being a corrupted Church, as long as we can prove it to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch groſs Errors as it does, altho accompanied with ſuch a mixture of Truth, as may be of great force to bring over ſuch as had before little or no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg thereof.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the Prevalency of the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can be no Note of its being a true Church, becauſe it is ſo much alter'd from what it former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was.

Afterwards new Doctrines inſenſibly crept into, and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:104627:133"/>were received by that Church, and at laſt Matters came to be ſettled as we now find them in the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> This has been often cleared by Learned Men, and in ſome of thoſe Diſcourſes which have of late been writ,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Barrow</hi> of the Pope's Suprem. Diſcourſe of Tranſubſt. Diſc. concerning the Worſhip of the bleſſed Virgin and the Saints. Diſc. of Commun. in one kind. Vindicat. of the Anſw. to ſome late Papers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> ſome of the new Doctrines have been traced ſtep by ſtep, and the manner now they came to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd ſet down; and in others the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has been compared with her ſelf, and what was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> has been ſhown to be quite another thing from what was held ſome Ages ago. Now it is impoſſible that things that are different ſhould be the diſtinguiſhing Character of that which is always the ſame. Since then I ſuppoſe it will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily granted, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has always been the true Church, the Efficacy of its Doctrine can be no Note thereof, ſince in ſome Ages thoſe Doctrines have prevailed in it, which are directly contrary to thoſe which have prevailed in other.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That the Prevalency of any Doctrine can be no Note of a true Church, where thoſe who embrace it are hindred from thoroughly examining it. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a thorough Examination it never can be rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; and what Efficacy can it have upon his Mind who does not rightly underſtand it? Now the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> exacts of the Members of her Communion a tame Submiſſion to, and Compliance with whatever ſhe propoſeth to their Belief and Practice: and by forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them the uſe of the Scriptures, ſhe takes from them the uſe of that Rule, whereby they are to judg of the Reaſonableneſs of her Propoſals. How then can the reception of her Doctrine be a Note of her being a true Church, when perhaps not one amongſt a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of her Members who receeive it, is capable of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding what he is bound to believe?</p>
                     <pb n="225" facs="tcp:104627:133"/>
                     <p n="4">4. That the Prevalency of any Doctrine can be no Note of a true Church, where Art and Force are made uſe of to make it prevail. For it is no difficult matter for cunning Deceivers to impoſe upon unſtable Souls; and it muſt be a great courage and conſtancy of Mind, which can make Men for-go Father and Mother, Houſes and Land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the ſake of Truth. Now that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has taken this courſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate her Doctrines, we may be aſſured by ſome of her own Members: <hi>There are,</hi> ſaith <hi>Eraſmus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in Annot. in Mat. 23.</note> 
                        <hi>thoſe who after a new Example make Chriſtians by force, but whilſt they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Propagation of Religion, they do in reality ſtudy the Inlargement of Riches and Power. Not unlike theſe are thoſe Monks who inveigle others to take upon them their Order, and do uſe a great deal of cunning to inſnare ſuch as are young and unskilful,</hi> and who neither under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Themſelves, nor the Nature of true Religion. And <hi>Stapleton</hi> declares very freely,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Eo ſane loco haereſes ſunt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Hereſies are come to that paſs, that their Gordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Knots are not to be diſſolved by Art and Induſtry, but by the Sword of</hi> Alexander; <hi>and the Club of</hi> Hercules <hi>is more fit to ſubdue them than the Harp of</hi> Apollo. I might quote ſeveral others to the ſame purpoſe; but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Practices of the Inquiſition in thoſe places where it is received, and the extraordinary Methods which have of late been made uſe of in a Neighbouring Nation to gain Proſelytes, do ſufficiently ſhew that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does more depend upon ſomething elſe, than upon the Efficacy of her Doctrine for the making of Converts: Which will more fully appear, if in the third place we conſider the inſufficiency of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal's Arguments, which are fetched,</p>
                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:104627:134"/>
                     <p>Firſt, From the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, From what happened in the beginning of the Chriſtian Church.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, From the particular Inſtances which he gives of Converſions wrought by thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt; As to the Scriptures which are quoted, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 19.7. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the Soul:</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. <hi>For the Word of God is quick and powerful, and ſharper than any two-edged Sword, piercing even to the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding aſunder of Soul and Spirit, and of the Joynts and Marrow, and is a diſcerner of the Thoughts and Intents of the Heart.</hi> It may be anſwer'd,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the latter of theſe is by ſeveral Expoſitors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted of the Son of God, and not of his Doctrine.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That if they are both interpreted of the Efficacy of any Doctrine; yet that the Efficacy which is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of is wholly internal, as we before obſerv'd, and conſequently ſuch as cannot be accounted a Note of the true Church. For the Note of a Church muſt be what any one can come to the knowledg of.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Suppoſe by theſe words was to be underſtood the viſible Prevalency of any Doctrine in the World, yet it would make nothing to the Cardinal's purpoſe. For that which in theſe SS. is ſaid to prevail, is, <hi>The Word of God, The Law of the Lord,</hi> i. e. the true Doctrine. But we deny the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be ſuch; and therefore theſe places are not applicable thereunto.</p>
                     <pb n="227" facs="tcp:104627:134"/>
                     <p n="4">4. Were theſe SS. applicable to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as having that true Doctrine which is oftentimes ſo efficacious, yet the Efficacy here expreſſed could be no Note of the true Church; ſince altho (as has already been ſhewn) the true Doctrine does ſometimes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, yet it does not follow, that it always ſhould: For it may be perverted, it may be reſiſted, and Error may meet with a much kinder Reception in the World than it does.</p>
                     <p>As for what <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith in the ſecond place, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Prevalency of the Chriſtian Doctrine in the beginning of the Church, we allow it all to be true; but we do not think the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be more concerned in it, than any other Chriſtian Church what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. What then happened does very much confirm the Chriſtian Doctrine in the general, but does not at all prove any particular party of Chriſtians to be better than another, much leſs the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe Doctrine, altho it was once the ſame with the Doctrine of the Primitive Church, yet what it was in the Cardinal's days, and what it is now, is quite another thing from what it was then. The Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans converted the Heathens from their Idolatry to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the true God; but the great deſign of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Miſſionaries is, to render their Proſelytes intirely ſubmiſſive to the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> in all things.</p>
                     <p>I might here conclude, did not the Cardinal much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon the particular Converſions wrought by thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> upon ſome of which, in the third place, I ſhall make ſome brief Reflections.</p>
                     <p>Now as to the Converſion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by <hi>Auguſtin</hi> the Monk, it may be replied,</p>
                     <pb n="228" facs="tcp:104627:135"/>
                     <p n="1">1. That the Centuriſts (out of whom he quotes this and the other Inſtances) do expreſly ſay, that <hi>Auguſtin; eas Eccleſias magis deformavit quam recte inſtituit.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2.

Laſtly, altho he might be very inſtrumental towards the Converſion of the <hi>Saxons</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> yet was he even in that Affair mightily aſſiſted by the Authority of a Chriſtian Queen named <hi>Bertha,</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. That <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s proud carriage towards the Britiſh Biſhops, and the death of 1200 Monks of <hi>Bangor,</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by their denial of Subjection unto him,<note place="margin">

                     <p>The next Miſſion which the Cardinal makes mention of, is that of <hi>Kilianus</hi> by Pope <hi>Conon,</hi> who converted the People of <hi>Franconia,</hi> whoſe chief City was <hi>Herbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi>
                        <pb n="229" facs="tcp:104627:135"/>or <hi>Wirtzburg.</hi> Now the account that the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turiators</hi> give of this <hi>Kilianus,</hi> and which makes him not to have had that ſucceſs in the Converſion of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as is pretended, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That being a Monk, and by Nation a Scotiſh-man,<note place="margin">Centur.

                     <p>The third Inſtance is, the Converſion of a great part of <hi>Germany</hi> by <hi>Vinofrid,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Boniface,</hi> who ſeem'd a little to miſtruſt the Efficacy of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, when he thus wrote;<note place="margin">

                     <p>Of the Converſion of the <hi>Vandals</hi> which he aſcribes to the Monks of <hi>Corbie,</hi> hear the account that <hi>Albertus Krantzius</hi> gives. <hi>The Vandals,</hi> ſays he, <hi>were a Nation

And as for the <hi>Bulgarians, Sclavonians,</hi> &amp;c. beſides that they were converted by their Neighbour <hi>Greeks,</hi> as well as <hi>Italians,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Bulgarians</hi> (whoſe disturbance from ſome Weſtern Miſſionaries <hi>Photius</hi> paſſionately laments) it is not a ſign that they were made ſo ſubject to the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ep. 2.</note> as is pretended; ſince, as the <hi>Centuriators</hi> tell us, when Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> would have obliged the <hi>Scla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonians</hi> and <hi>Polonians,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cent. 9. c. 2. col. 18.</note> whom <hi>Cyrillus</hi> and <hi>Methodius,</hi> who converted them, had taught to have their publick Service in their own Tongue, to have it in Latin, they ſtoutly reſiſted him. So that the Pope, that he might keep up his uſurped Authority, was forced to pretend that he gave them leave to have it in their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
                     <p>But amongſt all his Inſtances, the Cardinal had leaſt reaſon to have mention'd the Converſion of the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Jews.</hi> For as for the <hi>Indians,</hi> the unheard-of Cruelties which even the Popiſh Hiſtorians relate to have been uſed towards them, and their groſs Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance after their Converſion, are a ſufficient Evidence, how little they were beholden for it to the Doctrine which was taught them. One would wonder how it were poſſible for Mankind to be guilty of ſuch inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:104627:136"/>Barbarities as <hi>Bartolomaeus Caſas;</hi> who was a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and lived in <hi>India,</hi> relates the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to have committed. In abhorrence whereof <hi>Acoſta</hi> has a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on purpoſe to ſhew the Unreaſonableneſs of making War againſt the <hi>Barbarians,</hi>

He afterwards diſcourſes of the Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Indians,</hi> aſſerting that they ought to have better Inſtructors ſent them. That thoſe which they then had, had been of ſuch little uſe to them, that after the ſpace of forty Years, there were ſcarce any found amongſt ſo great a number of Converts, who underſtood two Articles of the Creed,<note place="margin">L. 4. c. 3. p. 358.</note> or had any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion what Chriſt, Eternal Life, or the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt meant. But this concerning the Converſion of the <hi>Indians,</hi> has already been mentioned in Note the fourth.</p>
                     <p>As for the manner of converting the <hi>Jews,</hi> I ſhall only make mention of one Inſtance, which happened in the time of <hi>Heraclius</hi> the Emperour, who <hi>writ to</hi> Dagobert <hi>the King of</hi> France, <hi>that he would command all the Jews in his Dominions, to turn Chriſtians,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Aimoin. iv. 22.</note> 
                        <hi>and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to baniſh or ſlay thoſe who would not; who accordingly did ſo, baniſhing as many as would not be baptized.</hi> Since <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> who knew theſe matters well enough, has ſo freely declared, that altho their Converſion be a thing much to be wiſhed for; yet that ſuch Courſes were taken by ſome to effect it, that <hi>of a wicked Jew,</hi>

                        <hi>it often happened there was made a Chriſtian much more wicked than he was before his Converſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having thus ſhewn the weakneſs of the Cardinal's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, all that I ſhall add upon this Subject ſhall be only this, That the mean Account ſome of our new Converts
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:104627:137"/>have given of Themſelves, and the Motives of their Change looks not very favourable upon this Ninth Note, and makes it ſuſpicious, that the Efficacy of Doctrine was not the only thing that did the work. But that on the other hand, ſince the chiefeſt Patrons of the Romiſh Cauſe do at this time endeavour to diſguiſe their Religion with ſo much Artifice, and to represent it as like ours as they can; they do really think their Doctrine by its own Worth and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, then moſt likely to prevail, when it is made appear to be moſt akin to that of the Reformed Churches.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>This Holineſs of Dedication is elegantly ſet forth (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of the Oriental Poeſy) in the Book of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> in which is repreſented the Spiritual Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of Chriſt, and his chaſte and unblemiſh'd Church. Though ſome Romaniſts have wreſted theſe and other places, which ſpeak of her Dove-like and undefiled Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and apply them to that which they pleaſe to call the <hi>Immaculate Conception</hi> of the Bleſſed Virgin<note n="(e)" place="margin">V.

                     <p>That the Church is Holy we daily profeſs. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs <hi>ſuch Holineſs</hi> of the Church cannot properly be called a <hi>Note</hi> of it, for it appertains to its Eſſence and Conſtitution, and ſhews what a Church is, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to every Church, whether <hi>Greek, Abyſſine, Roman,</hi> or <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and is not (according to <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Senſe of a <hi>Note</hi>) an <hi>External Mark</hi> by which we may diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh betwixt Churches, and upon grounds of good Aſſurance, diſcern any true one from ſuch as are falſe.</p>
                     <p>For the <hi>Second kind</hi> of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> that of <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Manners;</hi> neither is <hi>That,</hi> ſo far as Man can take Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of it, a certain Sign by which we may find out the <hi>true</hi> Chriſtian Society. For,</p>
                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:104627:139"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Officers of the Chriſtian Church invite Men of all Nations and Conditions to come into the Boſom of it, and admit them upon their Profeſſion of the common Chriſtianity, not being able to penetrate into the Secrets of their Hearts, or to foreſee whether they who are now in good earneſt, will perſevere or fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. They may, therefore, admit into the true Fold ſuch as are Wolves in Sheeps-cloathing. For <hi>Novatian</hi> himſelf did not deny that Men could be ſecretly wicked before and at Baptiſm, tho he was ſo rigid as not to believe the Sins committed after it to be forgiven. Hence our Saviour compar'd his Church to a <hi>Net</hi> which contained in it <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad Fiſhes.</hi> And the bad may either ſoon appear, or be long conceal'd under the cloſe Vail of Hypocriſy. So deceitful a mark of Incorruption in the Monument is the ſuperficial Whiteneſs and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf does here furniſh us, from <hi>Theodoret,</hi> with the Inſtance of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> who by the help of a pale Look, ſet Speech and grave Apparel, deceived both the People and the Officers of the Church; and, by ſuch Arts, lifted himſelf into an Epiſcopal Chair. <q>Now, he is not a Chriſtian who is meerly one outwardly; neither is that compleat Baptiſm which is outward only in the Fleſh: But he is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian who is, alſo, one inwardly; And Baptiſm is that which is, likewiſe, inward in the Spirit, whoſe praiſe is not only of Men, but of God.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Beſides,</hi> where there is no ſuch groſs Hypocriſy, there may be a ſpecious ſhew of Holineſs, not uniform and entire yet proceeding from devout temper, ſome Seeds of natural Reaſon, and ſome few Principles of Chriſtian Religion, whilſt the reſt are not embrac'd. Thus it was with the Sect of <hi>Priſcillian,</hi> who by ſome kinds of real Strictneſſes, upbraided the looſeneſs of that Age.
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:104627:139"/>Yet the <hi>Catholick Chriſtians</hi> did not, from the regularity of their Lives, infer the ſoundneſs of their Party.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe there are ſome Practices which both the Perſons and the Spectators judg to be Holy, which are not ſo. Such a Practice was that of <hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi>
                        <note n="(f)" place="margin">Maſſeius in vitâ Ignat. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 74, 75.</note> who gave an Alms readily to a poor Man, and to all the reſt, who upon that poor Mans Report, preſs'd immediately upon him, till he had emptied all his Stock, and was forc'd, that Night, to beg Bread for himſelf. This Charity, how indiſcreet ſoever it was, mov'd the poor to cry out with much Admiration (as Storyeth <hi>Maffeius</hi>) <hi>A Saint, a Saint.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Seeing, then, the weak will miſtake the very Nature of Holineſs, and the moſt judicious can only ſee the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal part of it, it is not ſafe arguing for the goodneſs of the Cauſe from the ſeeming goodneſs of the Life. It is true, we ought to uſe a <hi>Judgment</hi> of <hi>Charity:</hi> But, in a Caſe, where we are proving our Faith, it becomes us to proceed upon more unqueſtionable Grounds.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Under the ſame Conſtitution, People may live ſometimes with more and ſometimes with leſs Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality: If, therefore, we ſhould prove the State or Church by the manners of the Members, the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution at different Times, would be good and bad, and vary as Men do. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſpeaks of the Holineſs of Doctrine, and the Efficacy of it; but it is not irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtibly efficacious: And often we find worſe Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der better Means, and better Men under worſe. Thus it falls out in Civil Societies, where the Model remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or being improv'd, the Vertues of the Subjects de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline. It did ſo towards the latter end of the Roman Empire, in which, tho the Laws remain'd, the Dregs of <hi>Romulus</hi> began to riſe again. Thus it was in the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> which was always, as God had fram'd
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:104627:140"/>it, a true Church. But if Holineſs of Life had been made a <hi>Note</hi> of it, it might, in ſome Junctures, have been called a Church, but oftner no Church at all: Before their Captivity, there was a general Corruption of Manners; and their Reformation, upon their Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, was imperfect: And the Senſe of God's Goodneſs to them began to wear off; and tho they did forbear to adulterate the worſhip of the true God with mixtures of Idolatry; yet they admitted of the formal Religion of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> which made void real and ſolid Piety. Inſomuch that when our Saviour viſited the World he could ſcarce find any <hi>Probity</hi> in it.</p>
                     <p>There are many ways, by which Men, under the ſame Constitution, may lead more or leſs virtuous Lives. Such are, <hi>The good or bad Examples of Great Men; ſtrict</hi> or <hi>looſe Diſcipline; Affliction</hi> or <hi>overgrowth in Wealth</hi> and <hi>Power; War</hi> or <hi>Peace.</hi> And the laſt of theſe is too often, tho not the juſt Cauſe, yet the occasion of Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and of the growing of a kind of ſlothful Ruſt upon thoſe who are at eaſe.

                        </note> ſpeaking of the little quiet the <hi>African</hi> Church had for a few Years (from <hi>Severus</hi> to <hi>Decius</hi>) tho not without ſome trouble from the Heathens; complains of the Corruption which it bred among Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Add to this, that unleſs a Man do firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Nature and <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Chriſtian Church, he cannot know what <hi>Sanctity</hi> is, and what that is in the Life of any Man, which he is to take for the Holineſs of a Chriſtian. So that the way to be well aſſured about a true Church, is to take our meaſures, not from the Lives of the Members, but from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of their Society. And one might imagine that Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> himſelf<note n="(h)" place="margin">Card. Perr. <hi>Reply to King</hi> James. <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 6.</note> in this Argument had more regard to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> than the <hi>Life,</hi> when he alluded
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:104627:140"/>to an Expreſſion in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> in this fanciful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <q>The <hi>Church</hi> ſings, and will always ſing, I am <hi>black,</hi> but I am <hi>fair:</hi> that is to ſay, I am <hi>black</hi> in <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> but <hi>fair</hi> in <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
                        </q> Which blackneſs of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners if he intended as a ſpot of Beauty upon his fair Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, he did not ſee with Chriſtian Eyes. But,</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Admitting that Holineſs of Life were a <hi>Note</hi> of the true Church, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church would not, from this Conceſſion, derive any great advantage. It is true, and it is granted,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That at the beginning, the Chriſtians at <hi>Rome</hi> were famous both for their Faith and Manners. And no Man, that I know of, aſperſeth <hi>Linus,</hi> the firſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop there, who (as <hi>Platina</hi> ſaith) had a mighty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation for <hi>Sanctity,</hi> and dy'd a glorious <hi>Martyr</hi> under <hi>Saturninus</hi> the <hi>Conſul.</hi> But the like may be alledged in favour of the Mother-Church of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and of St. <hi>James</hi> the Biſhop of it. In the mean while, it may be noted that, in <hi>Rome,</hi> it being the Imperial City, there was a very early affectation of ſuch <hi>Superiority</hi> as Chriſt forbad in his Kingdom: And St. <hi>Hierom</hi> at the ſame time<note n="(i)" place="margin">
                           <hi>S.</hi> Hieron. Epiſt. ad Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellan. <hi>p.</hi> 127.</note> that he takes notice of the right Faith of <hi>Rome</hi> (for then it was contain'd within the limits of the Apoſtles Creed) he reproves that Ambition which had ſeated it ſelf in Purple on the Seven Hills. And this Leaven had before that time, ſwell'd the Contentious Popes, <hi>Victor</hi> and <hi>Stephen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It muſt be further acknowledged, that in the later Ages, there have been Men of that Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on devoutly inclin'd, and of good Morals. But this Effect has not had <hi>Popery</hi> for its Cauſe, but has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from Principles common to all Chriſtians. And it is from the influence of the firſt twelve Articles, and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:104627:141"/>not of the Additional ones of <hi>Trent,</hi> that ſuch Men have been ſo pious and ſo free from blemiſh. In this number are uſually put <hi>Thaulerus</hi> and <hi>Savanarola.</hi> And it appears by their Words, that mere Romaniſm was not the Spring from which their Devotions flow'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>There<note n="(k)" place="margin">Thauler. in Feſt. de uno aliquo Confeſſ. <hi>Luc.</hi> 11.</note> be many (ſaith <hi>Thaulerus</hi>) who go under the Name of Religious, who take great pains in Set-Faſts, Vigils, Orizons, and frequent Confeſſions: For they believe they may be juſtify'd and ſav'd merely by ſuch external Works.</q> For <hi>Savanarola</hi> his Spirit may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by ſuch Diſcourſe as this<note n="(l)" place="margin">Compend.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Have the <hi>Reformed</hi> ſo much of the <hi>Phariſee</hi> as to juſtify themſelves, and ſay, that in all their <hi>Field</hi> there has not been a <hi>Tare.</hi> But the <hi>Men</hi> have been in fault, and not the <hi>Cauſe.</hi> God be merciful to us Sinners; greater Sinners than ſome others upon one account, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as we offend againſt clearer Light. Yet it may be here noted, that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> has put into his Catalogue of Sinners, <hi>Simon Magus, Valentine, Marcion, Montanus,</hi> and ſuch others as do not at all belong to us; and that <hi>He</hi> and other Romaniſts miſ-repreſent <hi>Luther,</hi> blackning of him with ſlanderous Art, and then expoſing him as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Aethiopian.</hi> He was, indeed, a Man of warm Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and uncourtly Language. But (beſides that he had his Education among Thoſe who ſo vehemently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil'd him) it may be conſider'd. whether in paſſing

                     <p>Touching the Sanctity of Founders of Orders, St. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minick</hi> is one of <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s great Examples. But he muſt excuſe the Reformed World, if it will not take a blot for an admirable Figure.</p>

                     <p>For ſome other <hi>Orders,</hi> every Eye cannot ſee that contempt of the World which is ſo much talked of, and ſo ſeldom found.

But, I have related this too favourably for <hi>Bellarmin.</hi> For we hear him, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, poſitively affirming it as <hi>Matter of Faith, If any Chriſtian Prince ſhall depart from the Catholick Religion, and ſhall withdraw others from it; He immediately forfeits all Power and Dignity, even before the Pope has pronounc'd Sentence on him: And his Subjects, in caſe they have Power to do it, may, and ought to caſt out ſuch an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick,</hi> from his Sovereignty over Chriſtians.</q>

                     <p>HAD not the <hi>Cardinal</hi> either thought by the meer number of his <hi>Notes,</hi> to have given the greater ſhow to the <hi>Argument;</hi> or wrote in pure Compliance to the Humour and Intereſts of the Age wherein he liv'd, he would hardly have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon <hi>this</hi> of <hi>Miracles,</hi> eſpecially in the method wherein he hath manag'd it. For by inſtancing from the very <hi>Firſt</hi> Age of the Church, to the <hi>Fifteenth,</hi> nay to the <hi>Sixteenth</hi> (wherein Himſelf undertook the defence of it) he hath intereſted himſelf, in all the ridiculous Stories, the Phantaſtick Legends, which the Monkiſh, Fabulous Ages have deliver'd the meer recital of which (ſince he hath eſpous'd them) might be a ſufficient Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of <hi>his</hi> Argument.

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:104627:146"/>Authors but us'd the ſame grave Care and Fidelity, which that great Hiſtorian (tho a <hi>Gentile</hi>) profeſt in his writing the <hi>Peloponeſian</hi> War, <hi>he</hi> had loſt the greateſt part of this <hi>Note,</hi> and <hi>we</hi> been excus'd the pains of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining it.<note place="margin">Thucydid. l. 1. p. 16.

                     </p>
                     <p>However, proceed we to the Examination of this <hi>Note,</hi> as the Cardinal hath thought fit to propoſe it in proof of <hi>His</hi> Church.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>As to this, he premiſeth this twofold Foundation.</p>
                        <p n="1">(1.) <hi>That Miracles are neceſſary to evince any new Faith, or extraordinary Miſſion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">(2.) That <hi>Miracles are efficacious and ſufficient.</hi> By the former (he tells us) may be deduc'd that the <hi>Church</hi> is not to be found amongſt us <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> By the latter, that it is moſt aſſuredly amongſt them.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>Neceſſity of Miracles</hi> he quotes <hi>Moſes</hi>
                           <note n="(a)" place="margin">Exod. iv.</note>, St. <hi>Matthew</hi>
                           <note n="(b)" place="margin">Matth. x.</note>, and St. <hi>John</hi>
                           <note n="(c)" place="margin">Joh. xv.</note>. He further proves it by a Similitude of one neceſſarily ſhewing his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders received from his <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> by which he is autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riz'd to Preach; and by a Quotation from St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and the Conceſſion of <hi>Melancthon</hi> one of the Reform'd Perſuaſion; all which was needleſs, and the Similitude too weak and inconcluſive.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As to the <hi>Efficacy and Sufficiency of Miracles;</hi> He proves this, partly as they are the Seals and Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials God uſeth, without whoſe immediate Power they
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:104627:146"/>could not be perform'd, and who will by no means bear witneſs to a Lye. And therefore, where either <hi>Turks,</hi> or <hi>Pagans, Jews, Hereticks,</hi> or falſe <hi>Prophets,</hi> have pretended to any extraordinary Feats or Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments of this kind, either they have appear'd the meer Tricks and Deluſions of the Devil; or elſe, in the Attempts they have made, they have been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly diſgrac'd and diſappointed: So the Prophets of <hi>Baal, Simon Magus,</hi> ſeveral of the <hi>Donatiſts, Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin.</hi> In the Application of the whole, for the proof of <hi>His</hi> Church, and the utter excluſion of <hi>Ours</hi> from all Title to the Denomination and Benefits of a Church, he gives a ſummary of Miracles in every di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Age, by which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (for that is the whole drift of his Argument) hath been all along ſignaliz'd as the <hi>True Catholick</hi> Church. In the firſt Age, he mentions the Miracles of the Holy Jeſus, and his Apoſtles. In the ſecond, thoſe of the Chriſtian Souldiers under <hi>Antonius</hi> the Emperor. In the third, thoſe of <hi>Gregory Thaumatur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus.</hi> In the fourth, thoſe of <hi>Anthony, Hilarion</hi> and others. In the fifth, ſeveral mention'd by St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> as done in his time. In the ſixth, ſome Wonders done by Popes, viz. <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Agapetus.</hi> In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, Miracles wrought in <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk, and his Company. In the eighth, St. <hi>Cuth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> In the ninth, thoſe of <hi>Tharaſius,</hi> and great Numbers by <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr. In the tenth, St. <hi>Rombold,</hi> St. <hi>Dunſtan,</hi> and a certain King of <hi>Poland</hi> with others. In the eleventh, St. <hi>Edward,</hi> St. <hi>Anſelm,</hi> and (to make up the number) honeſt <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> or Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. In the twelfth, St. <hi>Malachy</hi> and St. <hi>Bernard.</hi> In the thirteenth, St. <hi>Francis</hi> and <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> St. <hi>Dominic</hi> and others.
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:104627:147"/>In the fourteenth, St. <hi>Bernardinus</hi> and <hi>Catharine</hi> of <hi>Senna.</hi> In the fifteenth, <hi>Vincentius,</hi> St. <hi>Anthonine</hi> and others.

                     <p>Thus having laid down the main Scheme of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal's managing this <hi>Note,</hi> which he calls the <hi>Glory of Miracles,</hi> I ſhall ſhew the weakneſs of this proof, as it concerns the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> diſtinct, and excluſively to that of the <hi>Reformed.</hi> And that under theſe three Heads.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>I. That <hi>meer</hi> Miracles, without any other Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at all, are not a ſufficient <hi>Note</hi> of any Church or Religion whatever.</item>
                        <item>II. Much leſs are thoſe Miracles which are alledged in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> any tolerable Proof or Confirmation of theſe particular Doctrines or Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, wherein we of the Reform'd Church do differ from them.</item>
                        <item>III. And Laſtly; We of the Reform'd Church, as we do not pretend to the working of Miracles in our Age, ſo if we did, we could pretend to prove nothing by them but what hath been already ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently prov'd by the Miracles of Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p n="1">I. That <hi>meer</hi> Miracles, without any other Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations at all, are not a ſufficient <hi>Note</hi> of any <hi>Church</hi> or Religion whatever. I add this Paſſage <hi>[without any other Conſiderations at all]</hi> becauſe thoſe Miracles which are
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:104627:147"/>recorded and embrac'd by all the Faithful, as part of the undeniable proof of Chriſtianity, are attended with all the Circumſtances that are requiſite to ſtrengthen and enforce them: Whereas, thoſe Miracles which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends to, in Confirmation of ſome Doctrines, which we differ from them in, they are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with none of the requiſite Conſiderations to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force them, <hi>i. e.</hi> they are produc'd meerly to confirm ſome particular Doctrines, which Doctrines have no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent advantage of being plainly and expreſly laid down in the Holy Scriptures, nor the Miracles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of being foretold by any Prophecy.</p>
                     <p>As for thoſe Miracles that in Primitive Days were wrought to confirm Chriſtianity in general. It was the infinite goodneſs of Providence to make them of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to order the performance of them in that way, that there is no room left for the <hi>honeſt, conſidering</hi> mind to reject them: Either as to matter of Fact to miſtruſt that they were never done; or as to their Force and Efficacy, to ſuſpect that they do not moſt fully confirm what they were produc'd for.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As to matter of Fact; they were done ſo publickly, and in the view of thoſe that were the greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and after they were done, they were reported partly ſo ſoon, in an Age when there were ſo many then alive that could have contradicted the Report if not well grounded; and partly with ſo much hazard, that as the very reporting them expos'd them to the rage of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to the uttermoſt: ſo the Falſhood of them, if it had appear'd, had brought upon them the ſcorn of thoſe that had been kindlieſt enclin'd. Whereas, the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that are more peculiarly appropriated to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they are never pretended to be done but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe of their own Communion, never for the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:104627:148"/>Conviction of any one Gainſayer, no one of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd Religion having ever once been an Eye-witneſs to any of them<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Vid.</hi> Pref. to the School of the Euchariſt.</note>. They come handed to us from a dark and fabulous Age, reported of Perſons, who themſelves hint no ſuch thing of themſelves in any of their own Writings, but rather to the contrary, as may be ſeen more afterward: And the Stories they have fram'd, gave them no hazard (excepting loſs of Reputation with all wiſe Men) for it was in a time when the Monk's Plenty, and Eaſe, and Freedom from all Dangers, gave them a Luxurancy of Thought and Fancy, and the Invention it ſelf a Title to the Favour of great Men, and perhaps to the ſame kind of Honour to be done for them after Death. So St. <hi>Bernard</hi> had the Fame of Miracles affixt to him by thoſe that came after him: as he had done to St. <hi>Malachy</hi> in the ſame Age with himſelf. So alſo St. <hi>Anthonine</hi> tells his Stories of St. <hi>Vincentius,</hi> and <hi>Surius</hi> his of him. But then,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Beſides matter of Fact wherein as to the certainty of the thing and the reaſons of Credibility there is ſo great a difference, ſo alſo is there, in the Force and Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the one and of the other, to confirm what they are produc'd for. There is a moſt unqueſtionable force in the Argument taken from thoſe Miracles that were for the firſt proof of Chriſtianity, but not ſo in the other, as we ſhall ſee anon. There are theſe Circumſtances that highly recommend the Primitive Miracles.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That thoſe that were wrought were generally ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beneficial to Human Nature, doing mighty offices of Kindneſs toward thoſe whom they were wrought upon: Such as, <hi>healing the Sick, raiſing the Dead, reſtoring the Deaf, the Lame,</hi> and <hi>the Blind, &amp;c.</hi> All which bore an excellent proportion to the great deſign of redeeming and ſaving Mankind. And if at any time there were
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:104627:148"/>any mixture of Severity in the very Act, ſuch as ſtriking ſome dead by a Word's ſpeaking, or putting others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the immediate Poſſeſſion of the Devil by the Act of Excommunication; yet was even this done, either in kindneſs to Poſterity, by fixing, in the firſt Inſtitution of things, one or two ſtanding <hi>Pillars of Salt,</hi> that might be for Example and Admonition, to after Ages againſt ſome Practices that might otherwiſe in time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Chriſtianity: As in the firſt inſtance of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> againſt the Sin of Hypocriſy. Or elſe, to ſome good purpoſes for the Perſons themſelves, as in the laſt Inſtance of Excommunication: So the Inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſon was adjudg'd by St. <hi>Paul, to deliver ſuch an one to Satan for the Deſtruction of the Fleſh, that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> 1 Cor. v. 5. None of theſe Miracles were ſuch uſeleſs Ludicrous Actions as the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Authors have fill'd their Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with. Such as that of St. <hi>Berinus,</hi> who <hi>being full ſail for France, and half his Voyage over, finding he had forgot ſomething, walks out upon the Sea, and returns back dry-ſhod.</hi> Such again, as St. <hi>Francis,</hi> beſpeaking the Aſs in the kind compellation of <hi>Brother, to ſtand qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et till he had done preaching, and not diſturb the Solemnity.</hi> Such as St. <hi>Mochua</hi> by his Prayer and Staff hindring the poor Lambs from ſucking their Dams, when they were running toward them with full Appetite. And S. <hi>Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi> keeping off the Calf from the Cow, that they could neither of them move toward one another. Such in a word, as St. <hi>Finnianus</hi> and St. <hi>Ruadanus</hi> ſporting their Miracles with each other, as if they had the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er given them for no other end but mere tryal of skill, or ſome pretty diverſion to By-ſtanders.<note n="*" place="margin">V. <hi>Colgan.</hi> in Vit. <hi>Mochua</hi> &amp; <hi>Finniani.</hi>
                        </note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. As thoſe Primitive Miracles were generally very bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to human Nature, ſo the Deſign of them was of the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:104627:149"/>greateſt importance and ſignificancy imaginable; and this both Deſign and the Miracles that ſhould confirm it, plainly laid down before-hand in the Prophecies of the Old Teſtament. The Deſign was, to bring in and eſtabliſh intirely an excellent Religion, a perfectly new diſpenſation of things; nay, further to aboliſh a former Model and Conſtitution of things, that had been formerly brought in and eſtabliſh'd by the very ſame Argument of Miracles. It was not to eſtabliſh any one particular Doctrine, that might be either in ſupplement to, or direct Contradiction of what had been hitherto delivered: But to ſettle one perfect and entire Standard, that ſhould be the Rule and Meaſure of all that we were to believe and practiſe to the World's End.</p>
                     <p>It is true, the Jewiſh Diſpenſation as it was fix'd and model'd wholly at the appointment of God by the Hands of his Mediator <hi>Moſes;</hi> ſo it was alſo enforc'd by ſuch viſible Powers from above that abundantly autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riz'd the Inſtitution, and gave it that Confirmation (ſo long as it was fram'd and de ſign'd to continue) that there ſhould be no kind of Miracle pretended, but ſhould <hi>then</hi> have its tryal by this Standard; and if any thing ſhould be wrought with deſign to draw any off from their preſent Eſtabliſhment, the <hi>Sign</hi> or <hi>Wonder</hi> ſhould for that reaſon be rejected, and the Pretender to it, tho he had made himſelf ſignal in performing it, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately condemn'd. <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. begin. But then, as things were then ſettled for a continuance of time only, and the change of the whole Scene was determined on the appearing of the promis'd <hi>Meffiah;</hi> ſo this <hi>Change</hi> and the <hi>Perſon</hi> that ſhould effect it, with all the mighty Works he ſhould perform, and the vaſt ſucceſs of theſe Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles accordingly, were all pointed out before-hand by
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:104627:149"/>expreſs Prophecies, utter'd under this very <hi>Moſaick</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation; <hi>The Lord thy God will raiſe unto thee a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, from the midst of thee, of thy Brethren, like unto me, unto him ye ſhall hearken, Deut.</hi> xviii. 15. To this Prophecy St. <hi>Stephen</hi> appeals in the defence he makes for himſelf, <hi>Acts</hi> vii. 37. And this is the whole Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Saviour thinks fit to give <hi>John the Baptist,</hi> that himſelf was the Perſon that <hi>ſhould come,</hi> viz. <hi>The blind receive their Sight, the Lepers are cleans'd, the Deaf hear,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. xi. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>the Lame walk, the Dead are raiſed up, and to the Poor the Goſpel is preached,</hi> as had been propheſied before.</p>
                     <p>Now if the Cardinal could have ſhown, either that a new Diſpenſation of things was to be introduc'd, after what had been eſtabliſh't by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, or that what was to be introduc'd, ſhould be alſo a freſh confirm'd by ſome new Endowments of Power from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and that accordingly the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> upon juſt warrant had introduc'd, and by her Miracles had autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris'd this great Revolution: Here indeed had been a reaſonable Propoſal to our Faith. But, as there is no hint of this in the holy Scriptures, nor no Prediction of Miracles to confirm it; ſo if any ſuch things be now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in any thing of this kind, they are no warrant to us to embrace it. There is, I confeſs a conſiderable <hi>Change</hi> foretold, and there is alſo a Prophecy as to thoſe <hi>Wonders</hi> that ſhould be wrought for the juſtifying of this <hi>Change;</hi> but then, this <hi>Change</hi> hath no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination than that of <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> or <hi>Falling away,</hi> and the <hi>Wonders</hi> by which it muſt be juſtifi'd, are to be no other than <hi>lying Wonders, with all deceiveableneſs of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs in them that periſh,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> ii. 9, 10. And as to this <hi>Change</hi> and theſe <hi>Wonders,</hi> if thoſe of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Communion think fit to challenge them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, we ſhall not contend with them in that affair.
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:104627:150"/>Here therefore is the juſt foundation upon which thoſe divine Miracles, that were wrought for confirmation of Chriſtianity, do reſt; <hi>viz.</hi> that the deſign of them was to bring in intirely a new Diſpenſation of things, and that this new diſpenſation of things had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determin'd by God, and the Miracles that were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it, when brought in, had their Teſtimonials be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand by Phrophecy. And this Teſtimony S. <hi>Peter</hi> builds upon, as having ſomething in it of greater certainty than the Miracles themſelves, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.16, 19. The Miracles he mentions, when he tells them, <hi>We have not follow'd cunningly devis'd fables, when we made known unto you the Power and coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but were Ey-witneſſes of his Majeſty: for he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from God the Father Honour, and Glory, when there came ſuch a voice from the Excellent Glory, This is my beloved Son,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And this voice we heard when we were with him in the Mount:</hi> But then the Apoſtle adds, <hi>We have a MORE S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RE Word of Prophecy,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And this is that I have propounded to ſhew, namely, that <hi>meer</hi> Miracles, without any other conſiderations at all, are not a ſufficient <hi>Note</hi> or proof of any Church or Religion whatever. The word <hi>[Miracles]</hi> I take in the comprehenſive ſenſe, and mean all thoſe <hi>Signs</hi> or <hi>Wonders,</hi> any prodigious Effects that appear to us out of the Courſe, and Order, and Power of Nature, which no one can <hi>ordinarily</hi> do himſelf, nor aſſign any reaſon in Mature for the doing of them; ſuch things may certainly be done, and yet be no Proof of the Truth and Divinity of that Doctrine they would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance. It is not queſtionable, but there may be ſome Miracles wrought, wherein the <hi>Finger of God</hi> is ſo plainly diſcernible, that it would render thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <hi>them</hi> inexcuſable. Such as once extorted that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:104627:150"/>from the Magicians in <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> viii. 19; and ſuch as our Saviour did ſo avow, <hi>Luke</hi> xi. 20. that from thence he charges the Jews with the unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, as may be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by comparing <hi>Luke</hi> xi. from <hi>v.</hi> 15 to 20. with <hi>Mat.</hi> xii. from <hi>v.</hi> 24 to 32. But then, there have been conſiderable <hi>Signs</hi> ſhewn and <hi>Wonders</hi> done, of which no Reaſons in nature can be given, and yet make no Proof of their <hi>own</hi> Divinity, and conſequently not of <hi>that</hi> they were advanc'd for. Such were thoſe which <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> when they withſtood <hi>Moſes,</hi> perform'd in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s view: Theſe, thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with one conſent, do acknowledg to have been the meer Deluſions of the Devil. Otherwiſe if the meer doing ſuch great things ſhould be a juſt Proof of their being ſent from God, what ſhall we think of the Feats of <hi>Apollonius Tyaneus,</hi> as they are reported by <hi>Philoſtratus,</hi> if but the moſt, or ſome Part of what he in a juſt Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of eight Books, tells us, were true: As, <hi>that he made a Tree ſpeak to him;</hi> that he <hi>put to flight an Hobgoblin, which in the ſhape of a beautiful Virgin made love to him:</hi> That he foretold many things, and particularly that <hi>whiles he himſelf was in</hi> Epheſus, <hi>he declar'd the Death of the Emperor</hi> Domitian, <hi>at that inſtant, when they were actually committing it at</hi> Rome: With abundance more of that Nature, which it were too tedious to recite. Indeed, it is not improbable, but that <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> was a right <hi>Sophiſter</hi> in the modern ſenſe; and as very a Wag at invention for his <hi>Apollonius,</hi> as any <hi>Monk</hi> in Chriſtendom hath been for any of his <hi>Saints; Photius</hi> his cenſure of him is, that the <hi>whole Story is fabulous;</hi> and having inſtanc'd in that Paſſage of <hi>Apollonius</hi> filling ſome Veſſels with Water, and others with Wind, by which he could by turns water the Earth after a long drought,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:104627:151"/>and blow the Showers off, and dry the Earth again, he concludes, <hi>Such like things as theſe, full of Delirancy, and many other things hath he prodigiouſly feign'd of him, that the whole ſtudy of a vain labour throughout all his eight Books is loſt, and to no purpoſe</hi>

                     <p>Again; What ſhould we think of thoſe Prodigies at <hi>Delphos,</hi> as they are reported by <hi>Pauſanias in Phocic.</hi> That when <hi>Brennus</hi> and the <hi>Gaules</hi> came againſt it, and the People miſerably afrighted, had recourſe to the Oracle, the God there <hi>bad them not fear, he aſſur'd them he would defend his own.</hi> Accordingly there break out <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, and Thunders and Lightnings, and Apparitions of ſeveral of their Heroes formerly dead, all the day long.

                     </p>
                     <p>And thus indeed, the <hi>Fathers</hi> all along do not ſuppoſe but that very great things may be done by <hi>Heathens,</hi> or <hi>Hereticks,</hi> which yet can be no proof that either of them are in the right. <hi>Origen</hi> in his firſt Book againſt <hi>Celſus</hi> takes notice of the Objection <hi>Celſus</hi> makes about the Conjurers in <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
                        <q>That they could put <hi>Demons</hi> to flight, could blow off Diſeaſes with their breath, could call up the Spirits of Heroes, could dreſs up the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Tables furniſh't with all manner of Delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p n="2">II. If <hi>Miracles</hi> in general, are no <hi>ſufficient Note</hi> or Proof of any Church whatever, much leſs are thoſe <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> alledg'd in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in Confirmation of thoſe <hi>particular</hi> Doctrines and Practices wherein we of the Reform'd Church differ from them, much leſs (I ſay) are <hi>they</hi> any juſt <hi>Note</hi> of their Church, or Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Truth of thoſe Doctrines. There are a Variety of Miracles offer'd to us in their <hi>Hiſtories</hi> or in their <hi>Legends</hi> in Confirmation of the ſeveral Doctrines of <hi>Sacramental Confeſſion, Adoration of Images and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, Invocation of Saints, Purgatory, the bodily Preſence in the Euchariſt,</hi> and <hi>the Holineſs</hi> of particular Perſons that have flouriſh'd in their Church. Now as to this, we are to conſider theſe things:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That we do not obſerve any ground throughout the whole Scriptures, either of the <hi>Old</hi> or <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,</hi> to expect any Miracle for the Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any particular Doctrine whatever.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That many of thoſe Doctrines which theſe Miracles are alledg'd in Confirmation of, are ſo far from being expreſly aſſerted or warranted in the Holy Scriptures, that they rather bear a direct Contrariety.</p>
                     <pb n="265" facs="tcp:104627:153"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That there is no tolerable ground for Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty as to the truth of moſt of thoſe Miracles which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> do make the <hi>Glory</hi> of their Church.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That we do not obſerve any ground throughout the whole Scriptures either of the <hi>Old</hi> or <hi>New Teſtament</hi> to expect any Miracle for the Confirmation of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Doctrine whatever. The Miracles under the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Diſpenſation, were to confirm and eſtabliſh <hi>that:</hi> And the Miracles perform'd by Chriſt and his Apoſtles (as I have already intimated) were to bring in and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the <hi>New Law of Faith.</hi> We read nothing through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Jewiſh State, that may make us ſuppoſe that any of the Prophets after the Death of <hi>Moſes</hi> (tho they were ſometimes endu'd with the Power of doing this or that Miracle) that they ever taught any new Doctrine which had not been deliver'd by <hi>Moſes,</hi> or which they undertook to confirm by any Miracle. It is true they ſometimes wrought a Miracle, as a Creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial for themſelves and their own Character, to ſhew that they were Prophets ſent from God. But then, the whole Errand of their Commiſſion, was to explain <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s Law; to awaken Men to a ſtricter Conformity to what they had ſo provokingly violated; to denounce heavy Judgments upon their Diſobedience; to ſpeak en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging things to a diſtreſs'd and perſecuted Church; and in a Word; to fore-tell the Events of future Ages, and particularly point out the Days of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and Revolutions of Chriſtianity. Again, we find that under the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel, the Miracles which our Saviour and his Apoſtles wrought, were to warrant the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:104627:154"/>whole new Oeconomy. And tho one main thing the Apoſtles were empowr'd for, was to bear Teſtimony to the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of their Maſter, yet was this chiefly as the whole frame of the Goſpel depended wholly upon the Truth and Evidence of this great Event; becauſe if it were not as fully made out that he roſe again, as that he dy'd, their <hi>Preaching had been vain,</hi> and their Attempts to aboliſh the Law and Conſtitution of <hi>Moſes,</hi> had been an unwarrantable Uſurpation.</p>
                     <p>Nor do we find that tho in a following Age or two the Church was probably bleſs'd with thoſe miraculous Powers, till the Goſpel was diffuſively enough propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated; yet do we not find that they wrought any one Miracle for the eſtabliſhment of any one particular Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, much leſs any Doctrine that had not been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the Apoſtles before them, nor enter'd into the Subſtance and Fundamentals of the Goſpel. Which leads to the next thing, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That many of thoſe Doctrines, which theſe Miracles are alledg'd in Confirmation of, are ſo far from being expreſly aſſerted or warranted in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that they rather bear a direct Contrariety. <hi>E. g.</hi> The Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> upon which is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed the <hi>Adoration of the Hoſt,</hi> which <hi>Adoration</hi> (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> not to be fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally true) is, by the Confeſſion of ſeveral of their own Authors, down-right Idolatry. Again; the Doctrine of <hi>worſhipping Images</hi> we cannot but think to be againſt the expreſs Law of God. The Doctrine of <hi>praying to Saints departed</hi> ſeems immediately to intrench upon the Office of the Holy Jeſus as he is our alone Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:104627:154"/>and gives to the <hi>Creature</hi> incommunicable Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of the <hi>Creator,</hi> as <hi>Omniſcience</hi> and <hi>Omnipreſence.</hi> And, to name no more, the Doctrine of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> with its appendent Doctrines about <hi>Indulgences, Satisfaction,</hi> and the like, they ſeem to alter the whole Scheme of the Goſpel-Inſtitution, by taking off from the infiniteneſs of Divine Mercy, and ſufficiency of Chriſt's Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                     <p>Now theſe are the Doctrines wherein the <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Roman Miracles</hi> have been generally concern'd. So long therefore as we think we have ſo much in the Holy Scriptures in bar againſt the Doctrines themſelves, we cannot but think we have moſt juſt prejudices againſt the Miracles by which the truth of theſe Doctrines are advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced or ſupported: We are directed by the Apoſtle, <hi>to prove all things, and to hold faſt that which is good,</hi> 1 Theſſ. v. 21. And <hi>not to believe every Spirit, but to try the Spirits whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be of God,</hi> 1 Joh. iv. 1. By the <hi>Spirits,</hi> doubtleſs muſt be meant no other than <hi>thoſe</hi> that pretended to <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying,</hi> to <hi>Revelations,</hi> and to the Power of ſome Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. Now it is very true, in that firſt Age wherein this Apoſtle wrote, among the <hi>diverſity of Gifts,</hi> there was this of <hi>diſcerning of Spirits,</hi> that adorn'd ſome Men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 10. It is not probable that the Apoſtle cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd <hi>theſe</hi> againſt <hi>falſe Spirits,</hi> for they were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powr'd to <hi>diſcern</hi> them: But the Warning belongs to the whole Rank of Chriſtians, as appears by the plain Rule he gives to try them by; <hi>Ver.</hi> 2. <hi>Hereby know ye the Spirit of God; every Spirit that confeſſeth that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the Fleſh, is of God, &amp;c.</hi> This ſeems to point at a ſort of <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> in that Age, that would be allegorizing the whole Hiſtory of our Saviour's Life and
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:104627:155"/>Death, and Reſurrection, and make it no real thing, but purely Myſtical and Figurative. Whoever therefore would pretend to the Gift of Prophecy or Miracle, and yet deliver this kind of Divinity, he muſt be rejected notwithſtanding all the ſhew he might make. So in proportion ſtill are we warranted to <hi>try the Sprits,</hi> to judge of any Powers of Miracle that are produc'd in Confirmation of a Doctrine that may intrench upon the great Offices of the Bleſſed Jeſus, or look new and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign to thoſe <hi>Revelations</hi> which himſelf and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles have deliver'd to us as the ſum and upſhot of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. <hi>Tho we</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>or an Angel from Heaven preach any other Goſpel unto you, than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accurſed,</hi> Gal. i. 8. <q>
                           <hi>Tho we,</hi> the Apoſtles that are veſted with ſo viſible a Power of Miracles; nay <hi>tho an Angel from Heaven</hi> (and certainly if an Angel ſhould come, he might be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of doing things beyond the order or courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as to us at leaſt, as hath been often ſeen by what Devils have perform'd) tho <hi>ſuch an one</hi> ſhould be propagating other Doctrines, and that, by all the moſt powerful Methods that ſuch ſpiritual Beings are capable of uſing, they are to be held accurſed.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our Saviour gives the Caution to all his Followers in every Age, That <hi>there ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets, and ſhall ſhew great Signs and Wonders, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that if it were poſſible, they ſhall deceive the very Elect. Behold I have told you before,</hi> Matth. xxiv. 24, 25. I ſhall only add the great <hi>Criterion</hi> of Miracles in the old Teſtament. Deut. xiii. 1, 2, 3. <hi>If there ariſe among you a Prophet, or a Dreamer of Dreams, and giveth thee
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:104627:155"/>a Sign or Wonder, and the Sign or the Wonder come to paſs; whereof he ſpake unto thee, ſaying, Let us go after other Gods (which thou haſt not known) and let us ſerve them; thou ſhalt not hearken to the Words of that Prophet, or that Dreamer of Dreams: for the Lord your God proveth you, to know whether you love the Lord your God with all your Heart, and with all your Soul.</hi> So long therefore as the Doctrines which theſe ſort of Miracles are brought to confirm, are in diſpute betwixt us, and after all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Enquiry we can make, we think that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of them do war directly againſt the received Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of our Faith, <hi>this Glory of Miracles</hi> is vainly urg'd to us as a <hi>Note</hi> of the true Church, when we are warn'd even againſt Miracles themſelves where they are pleaded to eſtabliſh them. All this upon ſuppoſal that all theſe <hi>pretended</hi> Miracles were actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally true. But then,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is no tolerable ground of Certainty, as to matter of Fact, of moſt of thoſe Miracles, which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> do make the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>their</hi> Church. The firſt inſtance of any Miracle wrought by the Relicks of a <hi>Martyr,</hi> is that Story of the Bones of <hi>Babylas.</hi> That Martyr having been Interr'd in <hi>Daphne</hi> a Suburb of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> when <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate came to conſult <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Oracle in that place, near an hundred Years after this Martyr's Interment, he could procure no Anſwer. Upon this, the Oracle was conjur'd at leaſt to give a reaſon of this Silence; accordingly it anſwered, <hi>Becauſe the Bones of</hi> Babylas <hi>lay ſo near his Temple.</hi> I do not find this Story call'd much into Queſtion by the graveſt Authors, nor indeed can we much wonder that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſhould for once give ſo open a Deference to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:104627:156"/>of an Holy Man, when by one ſuch an Act he hath ſo effectually emprov'd his Intereſts and Kingdom to ſo great an advance of Superſtition afterward, in all thoſe fond Devotions that have been ſince pay'd to the Reliques of pretended Saints, and all thoſe lew'd Fables of innumerable Miracles acted at their Shrines, which probably have been coyn'd upon this firſt occaſion of <hi>Babylas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is another Story almoſt of as ancient a Date; and that is of St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> having by Viſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd to him where the Bones of <hi>Gervaſius</hi> and <hi>Protaſius</hi> the Martyrs lay, which he took up, and after conſiderable Miracles wrought, ſuch as curing a blind Butcher, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he repos'd the Venerable Reliques under the Altar of a new Church which he had then built and dedicated. I am not willing to bring a Queſtion upon this neither, as to the truth of it, becauſe I find it not rejected by the beſt Writers, as well as told by St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> himſelf, and the Reaſon of ſome Miracles of that time might be in Vindication of the Catholick Faith againſt the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of <hi>Arianiſm</hi> that rag'd ſo fiercely at that time. Yet there are ſome Circumſtances that render it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſuſpicious; as, why that Holy Man ſhould think of not building or dedicating a new Church, unleſs he could be furniſh'd with ſome Reliques? There ſeems a good pretty tang of Superſtition in the very Thought; and then, the bulk of thoſe Bodies when they were found: They ſeem of a Gygantick Race, few of which I preſume were ever of a Conſtitution for Martyrdom. <hi>Invenimus mirae magnitudinis viros duos, ut priſca aetas ferebat. We found two Men of wonderful bulk, ſuch as olden Times were wont to produce</hi>

And then, thoſe that believe in Chriſt, ſpeak with Tongues too, when the old things are vaniſh't from their Lips, they do not ſpeak for the future with the old Tongue of their firſt Parents, who declin'd into Words of Wickedneſs. So when by Compunction of Heart and Confeſſion of the Mouth, former Sins are blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out, they muſt neceſſarily deſtroy Serpents, that is, extinguiſh the venomous Suggeſtions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> And thus he goes on in that alluſive way, accommodating the whole Chriſtian Life to ſomething of thoſe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Acts in the Primitive Days.

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:104627:158"/>upon thoſe they had to deal with. Thus much for the Perſons.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For the Doctrines: It would be too tedious to run through the various Heads of Doctrine, which they boaſt of as confirm'd by Miracles, many of which are ſo monſtrouſly ridiculous, ſo highly improbable, ſo confeſſedly fabulous, ſo perfectly needleſs and to no purpoſe, that they are not worth one minute's regard either to examin or expoſe them.

Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, becauſe our Cardinal hath thought fit to make <hi>this</hi> of <hi>Miracles</hi> his <hi>laſt</hi> Argument for the Proof of Chriſt's bodily Preſence in the holy Sacranent; and, beſides pointing at great numbers, hath himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon ſix or ſeven which he thought of the greateſt weight<note n="(e)" place="margin">V.

                     <p>It is a very conſiderable Miracle the Cardinal mentions from <hi>Paulus Diaconus</hi> in the Life of Saint <hi>Gregory,</hi> which I rather pick out, becauſe I find our <hi>Putney Convert</hi> very fond of it. It is of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that laugh'd while in the diſtribution of the Sacramental Bread,<note place="margin">Conſenſus Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terum. <hi>p.</hi> 69.</note> ſhe heard it call'd the Body of our Lord, <q>when ſhe knew ſhe had made it with her own Hands. Upon this St. <hi>Gregory</hi> prayed, and the outward ſpecies of Bread was turned into viſible Fleſh, by which the Woman was recovered to the true Faith, and the whole Aſſembly mightily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</q>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:104627:159"/>
                     <p>This were a good ſignificant Proof of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation indeed, if it were but true. Though here alſo a Man might as juſtly queſtion his Senſes at the ſight of ſuch a Change, as he muſt always renounce them in the belief of the thing it ſelf. But there are conſiderable difficulties before the truth of the Story will go down with <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For (1.) It is a very unlucky thing that never any ſuch Miracle was yet wrought in view of any of thoſe Churches that do profeſſedly deny this Doctrine. In the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice Actio</hi> 7. <hi>Theraſius</hi> the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident puts this grave Queſtion, <hi>What is the cauſe that Miracles are not wrought by any of our Images?</hi> and as gravely anſwers it himſelf, <hi>Becauſe Miracles are not given to them that believe, but to them that believe not.</hi> It is indeed what St. <hi>Paul</hi> intimates concerning the Gift of Tongues,<note place="margin">1 Cor. xiv. 22.</note> which moſt Interpreters apply to all other Miracles. We are the Perſons to whom this Ocular Demonſtration ſhould be made; and becauſe it hath not yet upon any Occaſion or Challenge whatever, been made amongſt us, we may reaſonably queſtion the truth of this, or any other Story of this kind which they tell amongſt themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Beſides (2.) this Story was writ by <hi>Paulus Diaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> about two hundred years after the Death of this <hi>Gregory,</hi> and in an Age as Fabulous as any hath yet been.</p>
                     <p>I add, laſtly, That the very Doctrine of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation had hardly got the leaſt footſtep in the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:104627:159"/>Church in the days of St. <hi>Gregory;</hi> it cannot be pick'd out of any of his Writings, no not in that paſſage which Mr. <hi>Sclater</hi> hath quoted from him<note n="*" place="margin">Conſenſ. ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terum. <hi>p.</hi> 69.</note>, which, I preſume, is the beſt that his Friend <hi>Bellarmine</hi> could direct him to, and which hath nothing further in it, than a pretty high Flight which ſeveral of the Fathers would take when they mention the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and what may be well enough defended by thoſe that reject Tranſubſtantiation to the uttermoſt.</p>
                     <p>The Cardinal gives us another Miracle from <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchaſius. de Corpore Dom. c.</hi> 14. which our late lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Reaſoner</hi> is very fond of too<note n="‖" place="margin">Conſenſ. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terum. <hi>p.</hi> 97.</note>. <q>The Story is of a certain Godly Prieſt, that was in great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ-treſs to ſee with his bodily Eyes the Shape of him, whom he certainly believ'd actually preſent under the <hi>Species</hi> of Bread and Wine. At length he obtain'd what he ſo long deſir'd, and beheld the Body of Chriſt in Human Shape, but in the Figure of a Child, which he had alſo moſt vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently deſired.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now as to this, beſide the Authority of the Book out of which this is taken, let us conſider to what purpoſe this Miracle was wrought, or the Story of it told in this place. The Cardinal is upon the Proof of Chriſt's <hi>Bodily Preſence</hi> in the Sacrament, and this <hi>Bodily Preſence</hi> is ſo receiv'd by thoſe of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Communion, that they believe <hi>that very</hi> Body, which was ſlain upon the Croſs, was buried, was rais'd again, and went up into Heaven, that that <hi>very numerical</hi> Body is <hi>ſubſtantially</hi> and <hi>intirely</hi> under the <hi>Species</hi> of Bread and Wine, the Subſtance of which is perfectly vaniſh'd. Let
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:104627:160"/>me therefore ask Mr. <hi>Sclater</hi> of <hi>Putney,</hi> becauſe his <hi>Friend</hi> the Cardinal cannot now anſwer for himſelf; Did our Bleſſed Saviour die an Infant, and riſe again an Infant, and does he now ſit at the Right Hand of God in the Figure of a Child, or in his Infant-ſtate? If not (and I hope he will ſay it is, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous to think ſo) how then did this <hi>Godly Preſbyter</hi> ſee the Body of Chriſt, as he ſuppoſed it tranſubſtantiated under the <hi>Species</hi> of Bread and Wine? The Subſtance of the Bread and Wine was gone into that Body that had been crucified. What! was there Tranſubſtantiation upon Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the proper Body of our Saviour gone into the Subſtance of a Child's Body? It may be this made him in love with thoſe Liturgies he quotes,<note n="†" place="margin">Conſenſ. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terum, <hi>p.</hi> 28.</note> wherein <hi>the Prieſt is bleſſing God for vouchſafing by him to change the immaculate Body of Chriſt and his precious Blood,</hi> &amp;c. To change it into what? per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps from that of a grown Man, to that of a Child or Infant. Well, but the Cardinal is ſomething more wary in the Story than the ventureſom Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of <hi>Putney.</hi> For he tells us the <hi>Prieſt</hi> had <hi>deſir'd to ſee him in this Shape.</hi> If ſo, and if he was thus far indulg'd, what kind of Argument is this for Tranſubſtantiation? What Conviction is this, that the very ſelf-ſame Body that hung upon the Croſs, and is at the right Hand of God, is brought down under the <hi>Species</hi> of Bread and Wine? But the Author adds in <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> That it <hi>pleaſeth God to work Miracles upon a twofold account; ſometimes to confirm the doubting, and ſometimes for the Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of thoſe that fervently love him</hi>

                     <p n="3">III. Laſtly; We of the <hi>Reform'd Religion,</hi> as we do not pretend to the working of Miracles in our Age, ſo if we did, we could pretend to prove nothing by them but what hath been already ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently prov'd by the Miracles of Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</p>
                     <p>We moſt humbly and thankfully adore the great Condeſcentions of Divine Grace, that hath been pleas'd in his firſt planting of Chriſtianity, ſo <hi>fully</hi> and ſo <hi>unqueſtionably</hi> to confirm all the <hi>neceſſary</hi> Articles of our Belief, with ſuch <hi>ſtrong</hi> and <hi>convincing</hi> Miracles. The Report of <hi>theſe</hi> Miracles we moſt firmly believe: We do without the leaſt haeſitancy own the Almighty Power of God in them, and entirely embrace <hi>all</hi> that Faith which they were deſign'd to confirm and eſtabliſh. We know of <hi>no other</hi> Doctrines that we have any <hi>Obligation</hi> to receive, than what are deliver'd to us in the Holy Scriptures, and ſo effectually ſeal'd to us. We have nothing <hi>new</hi> to put off or back with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Miracles, but are always ready to reject both the <hi>Doctrines</hi> when they are propos'd, and the <hi>Miracles</hi> when they are offer'd in Defence of them. We have no need <hi>to follow cunningly devis'd Fables,</hi> ſince <hi>we have a more ſure Word of Prophecy, to which,</hi> by God's Grace, <hi>we will take heed.</hi> And therefore all Miracles at this time of the Day are ſuperfluous to us: for if the Doctrine be not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to us before-hand in the written Word, ten thouſand Miracles could not warrant it; if it be to be found there, they may ſave the trouble of a
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:104627:161"/>Miracle, becauſe that Word of God hath been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently confirm'd in that Way already. This Word of God is the <hi>ſure</hi> Rule of our Faith, the <hi>great</hi> Character of our Hopes, and if the hearty Belief of <hi>this,</hi> and humble Conformity of Life to it, will not ſecure us at laſt, we are contented to loſe all the Rewards which this <hi>Goſpel</hi> hath made us to expect.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, ſince Matters ſtand thus with us, the Cardinal ſhew'd himſelf either a very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Diſputer, or was dropt aſleep when he makes <hi>Luther</hi> in vain attempting to reſtore a drown'd Man to Life; or when he tells a much lewder Story of <hi>Calvin</hi> out of <hi>Bolſec.</hi>

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:104627:162"/>no other than the ANCIENT Doctrine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by innumerable Miracles of old by the Apoſtles and Martyrs.</hi> What! Do they openly declare that they neither pretend to Miracles, nor need them in Confirmation of that Doctrine which they preach, becauſe ſo <hi>Ancient</hi> and ſo well confirm'd already, by <hi>innumerable</hi> Miracles wrought by Apoſtles and Martyrs themſelves, and yet ſhall it be threapt upon them that they betake themſelves to ſuch lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Arts of hiring poor Wretches to diſſemble their Death, that theſe may have the Vain-Glory of raiſing them? Either the Cardinal ſhould not have told this Tale, or he ſhould not have reported the Anſwer which <hi>Calvin</hi> and others have offer'd in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of themſelves.</p>
                     <p>To Conclude; We are ſo aſſur'd of the <hi>whole</hi> ſum of our Faith, that it is what our Bleſſed Lord and his Apoſtles have delivered to us, and we ſo firmly believe the Truth of thoſe Miracles which <hi>they</hi> wrought to ſupport and juſtify it, that we eſteem it perfectly needleſs and ſuperfluous to pretend to them now. Nay let me add, that we cannot but think that our very Contempt of <hi>thoſe Miracles</hi> which the late fabulous Ages have vended in the World, confirms us more effectually in the Belief of thoſe which the firſt Publishers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel wrought. Becauſe, it ſeems the great Artifice of that <hi>Father of Lies,</hi> when he ſaw he could not at firſt either defeat the <hi>Power</hi> of thoſe Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles by imitating them himſelf, or ſuppreſs the <hi>notioe</hi> and conveyance of them to the World, he would by an after-Game in a more lazy and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid Age, advance ſome <hi>Wonders</hi> of his own fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:104627:162"/>ſome of them very abſurd, and ridiculous, all of them very remarkable for their Superſtition, and ſo bring the thinking and conſidering Man to ſuſpect, that if <hi>thoſe Miracles</hi> have the ſame Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and were carryed on with the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, as <hi>thoſe</hi> by which Chriſt and his Apoſtles confirm'd Chriſtianity, that then, they may be all equally ſubject to Diſpute and Queſtion. And it is well for thoſe Countries where theſe Miracles are moſt boaſted of, and ſeemingly believ'd; if they don't find a very ſenſible growth of Atheiſm and Irreligion amongſt them.</p>

                     <p>BY the <hi>Light of Prophecy</hi> two Things may be meant.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That Divine Revelation, whereby a Man is enabled to foretell that ſuch or ſuch contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Events will certainly come to paſs. In which Senſe, altho they may be ſaid to have the Light of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy who are inſtructed what Events another hath foretold, and to whom it doth appear alſo that God hath communicated the certain knowledg of thoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents to him; yet in common Speech, the <hi>Light of Prophecy</hi> as it ſignifies the Revelation of Future Events, is uſually reſtrained to the Perſon to whom ſuch Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was immediately made. For he only is called a <hi>Prophet</hi> who makes known to others thoſe Future E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:104627:164"/>the knowledg whereof himſelf had received not from any other Man, but from God, <hi>i. e.</hi> who himſelf <hi>ſpake as he was moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Pet. i. 21.</note> Or,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Teſtimony that is given by the fulfilling of Prophecies to ſome Doctrine that was deſigned to be confirmed by it. And thus the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion was demonſtrated to be the True Religion by the <hi>Light of Prophecy;</hi> ſince whatever the Prophets from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the World had foretold concerning <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by the fulfilling of which he ſhould be known, was all exactly accompliſh'd in our Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and in the material Circumſtances of that Alteration which he made in the State of Religion. And in this Senſe we find the Phraſe uſed in the Scriptures; particularly by St. <hi>Peter. We have alſo a more ſure Word of Prophecy,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Verſ. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>to which ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a Light that ſhineth in a dark Place, until the Day dawn, and the Day-ſtar ariſe in your Hearts.</hi> Where it is evident that St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of that Teſtimony which was given to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by the accompliſhment of Prophecies, ſuppoſing it to be ſo clear and ſtrong a Teſtimony, that it would remove all Doubts, if any remained, concerning the Divine Authority of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Light of Prophecy</hi> in the former Senſe, is the knowledg of future Contingencies communicated to the Prophets; the <hi>Light of Prophecy</hi> in the latter Senſe, is that Teſtimony which by the accompliſhment of their Predictions, is given to others long after, for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of their Faith.</p>
                     <p>Had the Cardinal clearly diſtinguiſhed between theſe two Notions, his Reader might eaſily have ſeen how far the Light of Prophecy may be ſaid to be a Mark by which to know the True Church, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo far as to do Him and his Cauſe no manner of Service.</p>
                     <pb n="287" facs="tcp:104627:164"/>
                     <p>For in the latter Senſe it may be admitted to be ſuch a Mark; inaſmuch as the accompliſhment of thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, which concerned <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſhew'd that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was <hi>He,</hi> and that his Doctrine was of God. But then this Light of Prophecy comes no other way to be a Mark of the True Church, than as 'tis an Argument, or if you will call it ſo, a Mark of that Doctrine, the Profeſſion whereof makes the Church. So that when we have made the beſt we can of this Note, the Church is ſtill to be known by the Religion it profeſſeth, tho that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is known to be Divine, as by other Arguments and Teſtimonies, ſo alſo by the accompliſhment of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies.</p>
                     <p>And yet even here we muſt be ſomething cautious in laying down the fulfilling of Predictions, as an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove the Truth of Chriſtianity. For there are ſome Prophecies both in the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that in part have been, and will in time be fully accompliſhed by ſuch Perſons whoſe Doctrine we are by no means to follow. For <hi>Antichriſt</hi> was foretold as well as <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and when he comes and fulfils all that has been ſaid concerning him ſo long before; the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of thoſe Predictions is a Mark upon him, not that we ſhould receive, but that we ſhould reject him and his Doctrine. So that 'tis not barely the fulfilling of Prophecies, but of ſuch Prophecies only as deſcribed the Characters of that Perſon whom we were bound to hearken to and to obey in all Things, that is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of True Doctrine. And in this Senſe we are not unwilling to admit the <hi>Light of Prophecy</hi> to be a <hi>Mark</hi> of the True Church, tho it be a very improper way of ſpeaking: Since the Doctrine it ſelf which is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated to be a Divine Doctrine comes to be the proper Note of the Church; and the <hi>Light of Prophecy</hi> is left to
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:104627:165"/>be one of thoſe Arguments by which the Doctrine is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated to be Divine. But this way of <hi>marking</hi> for the Church, is very uncomfortable to the Cardinal's Friends, becauſe it will force them to acknowledg that 'tis not the Church that makes the Religion, but the Religion that makes the Church.</p>
                     <p>He therefore finding no advantage to his Cauſe by this Notion of <hi>Prophetick Light;</hi> wholly inſiſts upon the former, and makes the <hi>Gift of foretelling things to come</hi> to be one Note of the Church; and doubts not but to ſhew it in his own, and will not allow it to be in any other.</p>
                     <p>So that theſe two Things muſt come under Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>I. Whether it be a Note of the Church?</item>

                     </list>
                     <p n="1">I. Whether it be a Note of the True Church?</p>
                     <p>The Cardinal offers to prove that it is, by three Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments huddled up together, which being diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are theſe.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. That as <hi>Chriſt</hi> promiſed the Gift of Miracles, ſo he alſo promiſed the <hi>Gift of Prophecy</hi> to the Church.</item>
                        <item>2. That none knows Future Contingencies but God only.</item>
                        <item>3. That it is a certain Note of Falſe Doctrine, if a Prophet foretells any thing, and it does not come to paſs.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Let us now ſee what all this will amount to.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſt</hi> promiſed the Gift of Prophecy to the Church no leſs than the Gift of Miracles. To which it might be ſufficient to ſay, that as <hi>Miracles,</hi> notwithſtanding ſuch a Promiſe, are no Note of the Church; ſo neither is
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:104627:165"/>
                        <hi>Prophecy</hi> ſuch a Note, meerly becauſe it was alſo promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And there is the ſame Reaſon for the one as there is for the other, for neither the one nor the other was promiſed to laſt always in the Church. And we have been told ſufficiently that the Notes of the Church, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf, muſt be Characters that are inſeparable from it. Now the place by him produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, is ſo far from proving that the Gift of Prophecy ſhould flouriſh in every Age, that there are pregnant Intimations in it of the contrary. He refers us to the Prediction of <hi>Joel</hi> applied by St. <hi>Peter</hi> to the Church.<note place="margin">Joel ii. 18. Acts ii. 16.</note> And becauſe he refers us to it, thither we will go, and not as he does, take Things for granted which ought to be diſcourſed, but bring forth the Text and ſee what Argument it will afford. The Apoſtles, as the Chapter ſhews, <hi>ſpake with Tongues</hi> to the amazement of all the Strangers that heard them: But the Unbelieving Jews mocked, and ſaid they were <hi>Drunk.</hi> Upon which <hi>Peter</hi> lightly paſſing by that abſurd Reproach, told them that <hi>this was that which was ſpoken by the Prophet Joel.</hi> And <hi>it ſhall come to paſs in the laſt Days, ſaith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all Fleſh, and your Sons and your Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhall Propheſy, and your young Men ſhall ſee Viſions, and your old Men,</hi> &amp;c. And again, <hi>I will pour out in thoſe Days of my Spirit, and they ſhall Propheſy.</hi> Now tho <hi>Prophecy</hi> in the ſtrict Senſe ſignifies foretelling Things to come, yet it is here put for Supernatural Gifts in General, and particularly for ſpeaking Divine Things by Inſpiration, and likewiſe for ſpeaking with new Tongues; which is undeniably evident from hence that the Apoſtle's ſpeaking of the wonderful Things of God in Tongues they had never learn'd, was by St. <hi>Peter</hi> affirm'd to be foretold in this Prediction of <hi>Joel.</hi> So that the Cardinal ought to have been very much afraid to

And therefore I imagin his Followers will not follow him in this, nor advance the Promiſe in <hi>Joel</hi> into a Note of the Church, but will rather ſay, that the fulfilling of it in the firſt Age of the Church was a Teſtimony to the Truth of Chriſtianity; and that the Prediction of <hi>Joel</hi> was accompliſhed, tho the ſame extraordinary Gifts were not continued in every Age afterward.</p>

He ſays, That <hi>none knows Future Contingencies but God only;</hi> which if it ſhould prove that a Church is there, where the <hi>Gift of Prophecy</hi> is, yet it does not prove that there is no Church where that Gift is not, unleſs it be an inſeparable Mark of the Church to have all thoſe future Events made known to one or other in it, which God only knows. Our Saviour ſaid, <hi>of that Day and Hour,</hi> when Himſelf ſhould come to judg the World, <hi>no Man knoweth, but the Father only.</hi> Does it therefore follow that God muſt have revealed it to one or other in the Church? If becauſe God only knows Future Contingencies, it follows, that the Church muſt know them too by Revelation from him; then it follows alſo that the Church muſt know all things that are to happen hereafter, becauſe it is God only that can communicate ſuch Knowledg. If he meant that thoſe who have any degree of it muſt neceſſarily belong to the Church, becauſe God only can give it; neither is this true, as I ſhall preſently ſhew: Nor, if it were, could the Gift of foretelling ſome Things be for this Reaſon a Note of the Church, unleſs alſo the want of this Gift ſhould be a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:104627:168"/>againſt any Communion, that it is not a True Church, which I am ſure can never be proved from hence that none but God can beſtow it.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> This Argument is very impertinent, unleſs as lying Prophecy is ſaid to be a Note of Falſe Doctrine, ſo Falſe Doctrine be alſo ſuppoſed a Note of a Falſe Church; which is a very dangerous Suppoſition to a Church, that had rather be tried by any other Note than that of the Truth of her Doctrine: for it ſeems if we can clearly prove by any Good Argument, that ſhe profeſſeth Falſe Doctrine, it follows without more to do, that ſhe is no True Church. But,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is not ſaid in the place cited by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, that Falſe Prophecy is a Note of Falſe Doctrine; but that 'tis a Note, or rather an Argument, that the Prophet had no Commiſſion from God to ſay that ſuch an Event ſhould come to paſs. Nor does it follow from hence that the Falſe Prophet muſt needs be a <hi>Heretick,</hi> unleſs it be impoſſible for a <hi>Catholick</hi> or an <hi>Orthodox</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor to tell a Lye, which I think no Man will be ſo hardy as to ſay.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Much leſs is it ſaid that a Prophet's fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling rightly a future contingent Event is a <hi>Note of True Doctrine,</hi> which had been neceſſary to make True Prophecy a Note of the True Church. Nay, on the other Hand, there is expreſs Caution given not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore againſt being ſeduced into Idolatry by true Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>If there ariſe among you a Prophet, or a Dreamer of Dreams, and giveth thee a Sign or a Wonder; and the Sign or the Wonder comes to paſs whereof he ſpake unto hee, ſaying,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Which ſhews the Confidence of the Cardinal in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing ſo peremptorily, that there <hi>have been no true Predictions amongst Heathens and Hereticks, unleſs perhaps for a Teſtimony to our Faith.</hi> For this Warning plainly ſuppoſed that ſuch Predictions there would be, not to <hi>confirm</hi> Believers in the <hi>Truth,</hi> but to <hi>prove</hi> their <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> under a Temptation to <hi>Error.</hi> They muſt indeed be <hi>Falſe Prophets,</hi> as that ſignifies <hi>Falſe Teachers,</hi> who ſhould endeavour to gain Authority to Impious Doctrines and to Idolatrous Practices, by appealing to the Truth of their own Predictions: But yet they were to be <hi>True Prophets</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>Events</hi> which they would foretell. And therefore to pretend that Heathens and Hereticks never foretold any Contingency which came to paſs, but when Providence deſigned a farther Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to confirm us in the Faith, is, to ſpeak gently, a wretched Miſtake: And there is no more Difficulty in this Point, than whether we are to believe God or <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin.</hi>

                        </note> concerning <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (to which he adds thoſe of the <hi>Sybills</hi>) by ſaying that they were a <hi>Teſtimony to our Faith?</hi> As if the Argument were not ſo much the ſtronger, that the Gift of True Prophecy is not confined within the Communion of the Church. Surely he could not be ignorant that the Old Teſtament it ſelf is called <hi>the Word of Prophecy,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Pet. i. 19.</note> and that the main Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions thereof were for a Teſtimony to confirm us in the Faith. But by the ſame reaſon that he ſtrikes off the true Predictions of Heathens from being an Inſtance of <hi>Prophetick Light,</hi> becauſe forſooth they were for the Confirmation of our Faith; he muſt alſo ſet aſide the beſt Evidence of <hi>Prophetick Light</hi> within the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church; the Predictions whereof were no leſs, but more than any others <hi>for a Teſtimony to our Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the Oracles of <hi>Apollo</hi> which he does well to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject from being True Prophecies, we need not to offer them for the diſparagement of this Note of <hi>Prophetick Light;</hi> ſince they might be deceitful, and yet the Light
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:104627:170"/>of Prophecy neither be always in the Church, nor never amongſt thoſe that are out of it.</p>
                     <p>But when he tells us, <hi>That Hereticks are deceived as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as they would foretell any thing,</hi> and that <hi>this appears from the Falſe Prophets in the Old Teſtament;</hi> it is a piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing that ſuch a Man ſhould think it enough to prove a Concluſion ſo general by a particular Inſtance. He refers us to 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. where we find that <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Prophets ſpake by a Lying Spirit. But does this prove that Hereticks <hi>never</hi> prophecy truly? There were ſome Falſe Prophets amongſt the Ten Tribes upon their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt, therefore there never were any True Ones. How came it then to paſs that there were ſo many of the Lord's Prophets amongſt them,<note place="margin">1 King. xviii. 4.</note> that at one time <hi>Obadiah</hi> hid an hundred of them? There were ſome Falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets amongſt the <hi>Jews;</hi> were all the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prophets therefore deceived, when they pretended to foretell any thing? We find that God charged the Prophets of <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> no leſs than thoſe of <hi>Samaria,</hi> with Impoſture; with <hi>running before they were ſent,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jerem. xxiii. 14, 21, 25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> and <hi>propheſying when God had not ſpoken to them,</hi> and <hi>with propheſying Lyes in his Name,</hi> and a great deal more to this purpoſe. Therefore, by the Cardinal's <hi>Logick,</hi> it appears by <hi>the Falſe Prophets in the Old Teſtament, that</hi> Catholicks <hi>are deceived as often as they would foretell any thing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To conclude this Matter, ſince the Cardinal ſeemed to take a particular delight in proving his Notes of the Church out of the Old Teſtament; I ſhall leave this one Argument out of the Old Teſtament, againſt his preſent Note of <hi>Prophetick Light.</hi> To make it a Note of the Church it is neceſſary that there ſhould have been no True Prophecy but in the Church, which is notoriouſly Falſe, becauſe <hi>Balaam</hi> who was but a Heathen Diviner,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:104627:170"/>propheſied truly of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> It is neceſſary alſo that this Gift ſhould always have continued in the Church, which is alike Falſe; becauſe there was no Prophet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> between <hi>Malachi,</hi> and <hi>Zachary</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> that is for about 400 Years together.</p>
                     <p>And thus much concerning the firſt Inquiry, <hi>Whether Prophetick Light be a Note of the Church.</hi> I come now to the Second.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. <hi>If it be ſuch a Note, Whether the Cardinal hath ſufficiently proved that they of the Roman Church have it, and no others?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He pretends to prove that there have been Prophets in <hi>the Catholick Church,</hi> which no Body denies. But you muſt know that <hi>the Catholick Church</hi> is a Term of Art, which theſe Maſters to the Abuſe of Names and Words, as well as of Things and Perſons, are reſolved ſhall ſignify the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. Well; let the <hi>Roman</hi> Church be <hi>their</hi> Catholick Church; with <hi>us</hi> 'tis but the <hi>Roman:</hi> And now that we underſtand one another, How does he prove that there have been Prophets amongſt them? Why, he produces the Prophets of the Old Teſtament, and thoſe that propheſied for 500 Years after Chriſt; <hi>Agabus</hi> for Inſtance, who is mentioned in the <hi>Acts, chap.</hi> 11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now by this I perceive that it was warily done of the Cardinal, and not in courſe to call his Church <hi>the Catholick Church;</hi> for if he had produced the Prophets of the Old Teſtament, and <hi>Agabus</hi> with the Prophets of the New, to prove that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church has had Prophets, it had look'd ſo ſimply, that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal himſelf could not have born it. But this is one of their old Fetches, that when they would get any Credit
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:104627:171"/>by the Prophets and the Apoſtles, they call themſelves <hi>the Catholick Church;</hi> and then becauſe the Prophets and Apoſtles belonged to the Catholick Church, they muſt belong to them, and to no Chriſtians of any Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but theirs. But how I pray comes it to paſs that we have leſs Intereſt in the Prophets, the Apoſtles, and the Primitive <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> than the <hi>Roman</hi> Church has, nay that we have none, and they have all? One thing I am ſure of, that if our Doctrines and theirs be ſeverally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the Writings of thoſe Renowned Antients, it will not be hard to ſay who are their Children, they or we, and that they are <hi>our</hi> Predeceſſors and Parents, and not <hi>theirs</hi> in all thoſe Points wherein we differ from them. And therefore ſince 'tis in behalf of thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars wherein we have left the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the <hi>Prophetic Light</hi> of the Old and New Teſtament is produced as an Argument that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church has had Prophets; we have ſome reaſon to think that the Cardinal by producing the Prophets of both Teſtaments in this Cauſe, has given us a terrible Weapon againſt himſelf, and by their <hi>Prophetick Light</hi> diſcovered, that if the <hi>Roman</hi> Church and ours, cannot be parts of the ſame Church, then we who have the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles with us in the Doctrine we maintain, are a True Church excluſively to them, and not they to us.</p>
                     <p>In the next place we are told of <hi>Gregory Thaumaturgus,</hi> and <hi>Anthony,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the Anchoret, whoſe Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are related by St. <hi>Baſil, Athanaſius</hi> and <hi>Auſtin.</hi> Now <hi>Gregory</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Caeſarea, Anthony</hi> an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Monk, and <hi>John</hi> an <hi>Anchoret</hi> in a certain Wilderneſs of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> But how all this proves that there have been Prophets in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, is never to be made out otherwiſe than by ſuppoſing the <hi>Greek</hi> and the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Churches to ſignify the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, by the ſame
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:104627:171"/>Figure that the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and that of <hi>Rome</hi> are all one.</p>
                     <p>The expreſs Teſtimonies he brings are concerning St. <hi>Benedict,</hi> St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and St. <hi>Francis.</hi> St. <hi>Benedict</hi> told <hi>Totila</hi> that he ſhould reign nine Years, and dye the Tenth, which as <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith happened accordingly. St. <hi>Bernard</hi> foretold the Converſion of four unlikely Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: And which was <hi>very admirable,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, when he was deſired to pray for the Converſion of a certain Nobleman; <hi>Fear not,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I ſhall bury him a perfect Monk in this very place of Claravall.</hi> Upon which the Cardinal cries out, <hi>How many Prophecies are there in this one Sentence? For that he ſhould one Day be a Monk, and perſevere therein to the Death, and end his Days in a holy ſort, and that before St.</hi> Bernard<hi>'s Death, and this in</hi> Claravall, <hi>and that he ſhould be buried by St.</hi> Bernard<hi>'s own Hands; are ſix diſtinct Prophecies, and all of them not without God's ſingular Providence fulfilled.</hi> As for St. <hi>Francis,</hi> He <hi>admoniſhed the Generals of the Chriſtian Army,</hi> not to fight upon <hi>ſuch a Day</hi> with the <hi>Saracens,</hi> for <hi>God had revealed to him that upon that Day they</hi> would be beaten. But <hi>they contemning the Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Bleſſed Francis,</hi> fought, and were overthrown with a miſerable Slaughter. And <hi>many more things of the ſame kind,</hi> the Cardinal aſſures us, <hi>might be added.</hi> And if he had none of a better kind than theſe, he ought to have produced his <hi>many more,</hi> and at leaſt given us Number for Weight.</p>
                     <p>Now tho I could very willingly give him all his three Stories, yet I am loth to be thought ſo ſilly, as to take every thing of this kind for Goſpel, which we are told by <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> that wrote the Life of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> or by <hi>Gofrid</hi> that wrote that part of St. <hi>Bernard</hi>'s Life, where the Cardinal finds him a Prophet, no nor by
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:104627:172"/>
                        <hi>Gregory</hi> himſelf, in the ſecond Book of his <hi>Dialogues,</hi> concerning the Life and Miracles of <hi>Benedict</hi> the Abbot. The Story of the Blackbird that went off with the Sign of the Croſs,<note place="margin">Dial. lib. 2. cap. 2.4.</note> and that other of the little Black-Boy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible to all till <hi>Benedict</hi> ſaw him, that drew away the idle Monk from his Prayers; with many more ſuch rank Fables as theſe are, do plainly ſhew that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> had Credulity enough to have lived in the Age of <hi>Gofrid,</hi> or in that which next followed of <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> who is never to be forgotten for his Devotion to the Virgin.</p>
                     <p>But allowing theſe Stories to be well atteſted, let us ſee how the Cardinal proves by them that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has the Gift of Prophecy. Why he tells us that theſe Monaſticks were <hi>addicted to the Pope.</hi> Now how much <hi>Benedict</hi> was <hi>addicted to the Pope</hi> is not worth Enquiry; ſince his Prophetick Gift will do the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> no Service now that ſhe is ſo vaſtly altered from what ſhe was in Pope <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Days, who wrote the Abbot's Life,<note place="margin">Vindication of Anſwer to ſome late Papers. <hi>p. 72.</hi>
                        </note> as has lately been proved beyond poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Confutation. As for St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> he was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very far from being addicted to the Pope, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his ſharp Reproofs of <hi>Eugenius,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">De Conſider. ad Eugen. l. 3.</note> told him in plain Terms, that he was <hi>not a Lord of the Biſhops, but one of them.</hi> So that if his Propheſies too muſt go for the Credit of that Communion that agrees moſt with him in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, we ſhall put hard to get the Prophet on our ſide, by ſhewing that there was good reaſon to put him into the <hi>Catalogus Teſtium Veritatis.</hi> But for St. <hi>Francis</hi> we are very willing to let the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> take him, and his Prophecy, and to make the beſt of it they can. It is ſo very trifling a Buſineſs; that the Cardinal's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of ſuch Stories to ſupport ſo magnificent a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, as that of <hi>Prophetick Light</hi> in his Church, plainly
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:104627:172"/>ſhews that either he was, or ought at leaſt to have been troubled that he had no better.</p>
                     <p>He ſhould have remembred the juſt Exceptions he brought againſt the Heathen Oracles; and ſince he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to the Old Teſtament for this his Note of the Church, he had done well to conſider the vaſt difference between the Predictions of the Prophets there on the one ſide, and not only between thoſe Oracles, but theſe his petty Predictions alſo on the other. And then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he would have been aſhamed of theſe Proofs of a <hi>Gift of Prophecy</hi> amongſt thoſe of his own Party which he brings when he would apply this Note to his Church.</p>
                     <p>I grant that the Predictions of the Holy Scriptures are not all of a ſize, and tho all the Prophets ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt, yet ſome of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions had incomparably more clear and unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Characters of Divinity upon them than others had. And thoſe were the Predictions deſigned to give Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to our Faith, of which kind thoſe of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament made it to be <hi>the Word of Prophecy.</hi> For there we find that divers matters of Fact were foretold many Ages, and ſome of them thouſands of Years before the Event: that the time when ſuch and ſuch things ſhould happen is deſcribed by the Fall of Empires, not then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun when the Prophet ſpake, nor to begin for ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Years after; that ſuch Circumſtances were at ſo vaſt a diſtance of time foretold, that it was impoſſible for any created Underſtanding ſo much as to gueſs at them ſo long before they came to paſs; in a word that the ſeveral Things which the Prophets at ſundry times foretold concerning <hi>Chriſt,</hi> met in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and conſpired in bearing witneſs to him; the Evidence of that Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony being unanſwerable when all things were laid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:104627:173"/>For this was the method our Saviour took to confirm his two doubting Diſciples, <hi>He began at Moſes and ALL the Prophets,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luke xxiv. 27.</note> 
                        <hi>and expounded to them in ALL the Scriptures, the things concerning himſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Not that there were no illuſtrious Predictions before <hi>Chriſt</hi> but ſuch as were to be fulfilled in him; for many there were that received their Accompliſhment before: Such as that of the Birth of <hi>Joſias</hi> by Name, three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years before he was born,<note place="margin">1 Kings xiii. 2. 2 Kings xxiii. 16. Iſa. xliv. 28. xlv. 4. Ezra i. 1.</note> and his burning upon the Altar at <hi>Bethel</hi> the Prieſts Bones that had offered Incenſe there. And that of reſtoring the Jews by <hi>Cyrus</hi> the <hi>Perſian,</hi> tho neither he nor the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire was yet in being, no nor the Captivity begun from which he was to releaſe them. The fulfilling of ſuch Predictions as theſe, was a ſort of Teſtimony to the Truth of the Prophecies concerning <hi>Chriſt,</hi> till the time came when the anſwerableneſs of the Event ſhould above all things ſhew that they alſo were Divine.</p>
                     <p>If a Man would make the Gift of Prophecy a Note of the Church, and then apply it to his own, one would expect that he ſhould bring forth ſome ſuch Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions as thoſe of the Scriptures which are beyond all Exception Divine, for the carrying on of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. But inſtead of that, to bring two or three thin Stories, one of which is a Prediction of an Event that was to happen the ſame Day, is to expoſe a Man's Cauſe to the contempt of a Heathen if he were here, who could out of good Authorities produce more nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Predictions of <hi>Sooth-ſayers, Augurs,</hi> and <hi>Pagan Prieſts,</hi> that came to paſs. 'Tis a ſhame to ſee what pains the Cardinal took to ſplit St. <hi>Bernard</hi>'s Prediction concerning the Nobleman's turning Monk, into <hi>ſix ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Prophecies,</hi> after honeſt <hi>Gofrid</hi> could find but <hi>two</hi> there. If this were a place to make Sport, it would
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:104627:173"/>be no unpleaſant work to be a little ſevere in caſting up the Account again. But certainly if a Heathen were to read this Twelfth Note of the Cardinal, and there find the <hi>Gift of Prophecy</hi> made a mark of the Society that is united by True Religion, as he would gueſs <hi>the Church</hi> means, he would be apt to think that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians could produce no better Prophecies than theſe of <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s collecting, to prove there has been a <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Light</hi> in the Church; which if it were true of the Catholick Church in all Ages, would be no little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement to it; and being true of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, is no leſs a diſparagement to that, if the Gift of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy be a <hi>Note:</hi> For if the Cardinal had better, why did he not produce them?</p>
                     <p>I do not by any means deny that ſome Predictions may be truly Divine, which yet are far from having the unqueſtionable Characters of Divinity upon them. One Man may by his skill in thoſe Affairs foreſee the loſs of a Battel which no Man but himſelf compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the reaſon of. Another may boldly and at all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture foretell it without reaſon, and pretend a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation for it. And yet <hi>Micaiah</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Ahab</hi> foretold ſuch a thing by Divine Revelation. But then they are not ſuch Predictions as theſe, that will of themſelves ſerve a Man's turn to prove the Gift of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy to be in his Communion. In conjunction with others that are unqueſtionably Divine, they may be brought into the Argument, but not alone; becauſe it is ſo very difficult to diſtinguiſh them from Predictions that are not Divine, when they are abſtracted from other Conſiderations.</p>
                     <pb n="302" facs="tcp:104627:174"/>
                     <p>I am alſo as willing to grant that ſince the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably Divine Predictions of the Old and New Teſtament, when God poured out the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy upon his Servants, there have been now and then in the Church ſome ſprinklings of it, and that ſeveral Perſons have foretold Things by Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, which had no Evidence of it comparable to what the great ſtrokes of Scripture-Prophecy have. Such a Prediction I would allow that of <hi>Benedict</hi> to be which the Cardinal cites, if one had good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe it. And I would not much quarrel with that which <hi>Gofrid</hi> tells of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> though I have no great Opinion of it. But for St. <hi>Francis</hi> I deſire to be wholly excuſed. Which I do not ſay as if there were any danger of granting that there has been ſomething of this lower degree of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy amongſt ſome in the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion: for if <hi>Prophetick Light</hi> were a Note of the Church, 'tis not the foretelling of a few Events that happen not long after the Prediction, which will amount to it, tho there may be more reaſon, upon the account of the Holineſs of the Perſon, or ſome ſuch other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, to aſcribe it to a Divine Revelation, than to any other Cauſe. As there are ſome Divine Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles that have the <hi>Finger of God,</hi> while others are hard to be diſtinguiſhed from Deluſions and Lying Wonders; So ſome Divine Predictions there are which have the Characters of God's Omniſcience upon them, while others are capable of being reſolved into other Cauſes: But he muſt be at a great loſs for Church-Marks, that would mark his Church by Prophetick Light without the former.</p>
                     <pb n="303" facs="tcp:104627:174"/>
                     <p>As for the latter, I have ſaid once already, and I ſay it again, that they may, nay I am apt to think that they have had ſome ſuch in the <hi>Roman</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. But the Cardinal is very unlucky in his Inſtances, as ſome others of that Church are whom I have conſulted. I cannot ſee why ſuch a-doe ſhould be made about the Predictions of <hi>Philippus Nerius</hi> the <hi>Florentine,</hi> that care muſt be taken to preſerve the Atteſtations of them.<note place="margin">Vita Phil. Ner. p. 76. Mog.</note> When he could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade a <hi>Jew</hi> to pray to <hi>Chriſt</hi> for himſelf, he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Standers-by to pray for him, promiſing them that he would be converted; which came to paſs, as we are told, in a few Days. Again,<note place="margin">P. 100.</note> when one of his Converts had lent a ſum of Mony to a Banker, he made him go and fetch it back before Night, tho he knew not the Man; and within a few Days the Banker broke. Sometimes he foretold that ſuch a Sick Man would dye, and ſometimes that ſuch an one would recover. Which Predictions are as modeſt as may be; but no other reaſon can be given, I think, why <hi>Nerius</hi> muſt for ſuch Things as theſe paſs for a Prophet, but that they cannot write the Lives of their Saints, without ſtuffing them as with Miracles, and Viſions, and Extaſies, ſo ſometimes with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies too, and then they muſt be content with ſuch as can be had.<note place="margin">S. Roſae Vita c. 18.</note> The Good Writer of St. <hi>Roſe</hi>'s Life took great pains to make her a Propheteſs not long before her Death: For ſhe, forſooth, knew by Divine Inſpiration that a Convent of St. <hi>Catherine</hi> of <hi>Siena</hi> would be built, and this, ten Years before the Foundation was laid; ſhe had it ſhewn ſometimes by Signs and Figures, ſometimes in the exact Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Model, and would talk of it as if ſhe had
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:104627:175"/>it before her Eyes; ſhe drew it out upon a Paper, and ſhe could tell who would be the firſt Abbeſs there, knew her by Face, and after a ſort conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated her by a Kiſs, inſomuch that ſome thought ſhe was mad.</p>
                     <p>It is as hard to believe that the Spirit of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſhould be given to a Maid, for no other end as it ſhould ſeem by this Story, but to get her the Fame of a Propheteſs, as that the Ludicrous Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, that do no manner of Good, are the Marks of Divine Power.</p>
                     <p>It may be reaſonable to believe that ſome meaſure of this Gift is imparted, when not only the Event anſwers the Prediction, but when the End aimed at is Great and Good, and of General Uſe, as when God ſent Prophets to his People <hi>to bring them back to the Law.</hi> I ſhould therefore make no Difficulty to allow that <hi>Hieronymus Savonarola</hi> a very Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Friar in <hi>Florence,</hi> was ſometimes enlightned with Prophetick Knowledg, becauſe he did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foretell ſeveral Things that happened, ſome in his Life-time, ſome after his Death, and others that are yet to come to paſs; but his Buſineſs was plainly this, to awaken Men to Repentance, and to forewarn the Great Ones themſelves of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God hanging over them, if they would not do their parts to reſtore good Diſcipline and good Manners to the Church. Thus, as <hi>Philip de Comminees</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Chron. du Roy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ch. 25. p. 338.</note> he aſſured <hi>Charles</hi> the VIII that he ſhould be very proſperous in his Voyage into <hi>Italy,</hi> and this that he might reform the corrupt State of the Church, which if he ſhould neglect to
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:104627:175"/>do, he ſhould return with Diſhonour, and God would reſerve that Work for another; and ſo it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened. He was a Man of ſingular Vertue and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and obtain'd the Reputation of a Prophet, not only with<note n="†" place="margin">Guicciard. Hiſt. lib. ii. p. 42.</note> the greateſt part of the People, but with ſuch Men as <hi>Philip de Comminees,</hi> who knew him well; and that Noble Earl <hi>Jo. Franciſcus Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> who wrote his Life. To which we may add that he was ſerved as God's Prophets ſometimes have been, being put to Death at the Inſtigation of the Pope. And for what reaſon do we think? but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he propheſied againſt the Simony, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and Prophaneneſs that reigned in the Church; for which he was accus'd of Preaching ſcandalouſly againſt the Manners of the Clergy and Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lib. iii. p. 94.</note> In ſhort, he was ſilenced by Pope <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the VIth, and at length upon the Pope's Proceſs againſt him, he with two of his Companions were tormented, and all to make him deny that he had received thoſe things from God which he had ſaid,<note place="margin">Vita Savonar.</note> and after horrible Tortures, which he endured with great Patience, he and they were at once hanged and burned; to the everlaſting Infamy of ſome-body, and no leſs to their Confuſion, who will needs have it believed that there have been Prophets in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Communion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Savonarola</hi> was put to Death in the Year 1498, a little before the Reformation. It was about an 150 Years before that, that <hi>Joannes de Rupe Sciſſa,</hi> ſuch an other Man as <hi>Savonarola,</hi> and a Monk, propheſied to the ſame purpoſe that he did after-him, foretelling ſeveral Things that happened af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:104627:176"/>in the Kingdom of <hi>France;</hi> but running out into the Reproof of the Luxury and Vices of the Pope and the Great Church-men, Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> laid hold on him,<note place="margin">Froſſard. Chron. Tom. 1, 2.</note> and kept him in Priſon, as <hi>Froſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſard</hi> acquaints us, who relates theſe Things at large. If there were room for it, I believe ſome more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this kind might be added, to ſhew that which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> has aimed at, but failed of doing, <hi>viz.</hi> That they have had in their Communion ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who cannot reaſonably be denied to have had the Revelation of <hi>ſome</hi> Future Events. But let the Inſtance of <hi>Savonarola</hi> be by no means forgotten, for 'tis the cleareſt of any that I ever yet met with for that purpoſe, and which is ſomething more, his Story ſtands upon better Authorities by far than that of <hi>Gofrid,</hi> or that of <hi>Bonaventure.</hi> And thus having found out Prophets for them, let the Cardinal's Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers make the beſt on't.</p>
                     <p>For what remains; the Cardinal's proof that <hi>Luther</hi> had nothing of the Gift of Prophecy is very inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, allowing <hi>Cochleus</hi>'s Story, that <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Cardinals, &amp;c.</hi> would all vaniſh if himſelf ſhould go on to preach two Years longer. It does by no means appear that he ſpake this with a pretence to the Spirit of Prophecy, but it is rather evident that he did not, ſince his belief of this Succeſs was grounded upon the Suppoſition of his preaching ſo much longer. Nor was it very much to be admired, if a Man of his fervent Spirit, who had in ſo little time drawn off ſuch Multitudes from their dependence upon the <hi>Roman</hi> See, ſhould promiſe himſelf in ſo good a Cauſe that the Papacy would in a ſhort time
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:104627:176"/>be generally forſaken. The Event indeed was not anſwerable to his Aſſurance, and this ſhewed that he was miſtaken in his Opinion; but there was nothing of the Falſe Prophet in the Caſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Melancton,</hi> who may be believed concerning <hi>Luther,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Vita Lutheri a Mel.</note> as well as <hi>Bonaventure</hi> concerning St. <hi>Francis,</hi> tells us of ſeveral Things that <hi>Luther</hi> foretold; others ſay the ſame for <hi>Melancton.</hi> The Prediction of <hi>John Huſs,</hi> that an hundred years after, they that burned him ſhould have to do with a <hi>Swan</hi> that would find them work; and the Event proving accordingly, is known by All. Theſe are Things we think fit to obſerve: but we are of a Church that does not put us upon that hard Service, as to make a Note out of them. For that Church that has the True Notes, does not need any Falſe Ones.</p>

                     <p>THE Subſtance of what the Cardinal contends for in this Chapter amounts to no more than this, That the force of Truth is ſo great that the Enemies of it are conſtrained to bear witneſs to it. And whereas Catholicks (by which he means the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of the Roman Communion) neither praiſe nor approve either the Doctrine, or Life of Heathens or Hereticks, but affirm them all to err, who follow not their Doctrine; yet <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Jews, Turks</hi> and <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> ſpeak well of them. This he accounts an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they are in the right, the <hi>Confeſſion of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> being very conſiderable in this Caſe. And that their Enemies do bear this Teſtimony, he attempts to prove by an induction of Particulars from the Writings
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:104627:178"/>of <hi>Pagans, Jews, &amp;c.</hi> which ſhall be conſidered in due place. For the clearing of this whole matter I ſhall do theſe things:
<list>
                           <item>I. Enquire whether this <hi>Confeſſion of Enemies</hi> be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Note of the Church, or not.</item>
                           <item>II. If that ſhould be granted, the next Enquiry will be, Whether or not the Particulars produced by the Cardinal do evince that this Note is peculiar to the Roman Church excluſively to other Chriſtians that are not of her Communion.</item>
                           <item>III. I ſhall examine the Queſtion a little further, and more eſpecially the Teſtimony of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">I. Enquire whether this <hi>Confeſſion of Enemies</hi> be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Note of the Church, or not.</p>
                     <p>If it be no <hi>Note,</hi> the Cardinal might have ſpared the pains of this Chapter. And that it is none, I make no doubt to make appear beyond all exception: And here I appeal to the Cardinal himſelf; nor ſhall I need any other Argument to prove it to be none than what I borrow from him.<note place="margin">Cap. 2.</note> He hath told us what things are required to conſtitute Notes of the Church; and I am well content in this matter to be concluded by him. He tells us, amongſt other things, that <hi>true Notes are inſeparable from the true Church.</hi> In this we are agreed, and ſhall eaſily allow this <hi>Confeſſion of Adverſaries</hi> to be a true Note, if it be inſeparable from the true Church. But if the true Church may be without it, it can be no true Note of it. For that can never bring me to the certain knowledge of a thing which may or may not belong to it, and is ſo far from being eſſential to it, that the thing may not only be without it, but muſt be before this can belong to it, and will continue to be
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:104627:178"/>tho this ſhould not be at all. This is plainly the Caſe: The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> muſt be the true Church (as the Cardinal pretends) becauſe <hi>Jews, Pagans</hi> and <hi>Turks, &amp;c.</hi> bear witneſs to her. But this Confeſſion of her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries is eſſential, and an inſeparable Mark of this Church, or it is not. If it be not, it can be no true Note. And if it be, then the true Church cannot be without it, and we could not have known it to be a true Church, if it had not happened that Jews and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had born their Teſtimony to her; ſo that upon the matter the Church is much beholden to her Enemies for this Note; for had not they chanced to have ſpoken well of her, this Note had been quite loſt; and yet 'tis abſurd to ſuppoſe ſhe could be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>Note,</hi> which is, according to the Cardinal, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is inſeparable. Certainly the True Church muſt be before ſhe had any Enemies, and might have continued a True Church, if theſe Enemies had not ſpoken well of her at all, and therefore it is very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to make this Confeſſion of her Adverſaries an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable Note that ſhe is a True Church when if ſhe ever were a True Church ſhe muſt be ſo before theſe Adverſaries did teſtify of her.</p>
                     <p>There was a Time, in the Infancy of the Chriſtian Church, when the Church was <hi>every where ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 28.22. with Chap. 24.5, 14.</note> and when the whole Chriſtian Religion was by its Adverſaries called <hi>Hereſy:</hi> A Time there was before the Adverſaries of the Church, Pagans and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had made this Confeſſion. The Church at that time was no true Church, or elſe this <hi>Confeſſion of Adverſaries</hi> is no inſeparable Note of it. Either there was no true Church in that Primitive Time, or elſe this Confeſſion of Enemies muſt be diſcharged from being a Note.</p>
                     <pb n="312" facs="tcp:104627:179"/>
                     <p>But this Confeſſion is a <hi>Note</hi> of the Cardinal's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the Head of the Church, never made it one.

                     <p>So far is this <hi>Confeſſion of Adverſaries</hi> from being a Note of a true Church, as the Cardinal would make it, that the Reproaches and Scoffs of Enemies is no Reflection upon the true Church of Chriſt. The worſt of Men do not uſe to treat the beſt things well; and when theſe bad Men are Enemies they do no Prejudice with wiſe Men by their Invectives and Reproaches.<note place="margin">Qui enim ſcit illum, intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere poteſt non niſi ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid bonum grande à Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.

                        <hi>Tertullian</hi> concludes the Chriſtian Religion good, becauſe <hi>Nero,</hi> one of the worſt of Men, bent his Force againſt it. The Church will want nothing that is required though Jews and Pagans ſhould with one Conſent perpetually declaim againſt her.</p>
                     <p>In a word, this <hi>Confeſſion of Adverſaries,</hi> of what uſe ſoever it may be, can be no Note; for it is contingent and arbitrary, and lies at the pleaſure of thoſe who are not only out of the Church, but Enemies to it; and in
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:104627:179"/>the Infancy of Chriſtianity the Church was without this Note; and if that be allowed to be a true Church, this can be no true Note of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. But if it ſhould be granted that this is a true Note, the next Enquiry will be, whether or not the Particulars produced by the Cardinal do evince that this Note is peculiar to the Roman Church <hi>excluſively</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſtians that are not of her Communion?</p>
                     <p>'Tis certain that by the true Church (the Notes whereof the Cardinal attempts to give us) he means only the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">V. C. vi. &amp; C. ix. &amp; C. xi.</note> And what in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his Book he calls the <hi>true Church,</hi> he calls after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>our Church,</hi> and makes them both one and the ſame: At laſt it comes to <hi>our Catholick Church</hi> with him.</p>
                     <p>So that this Note of his which he calls the <hi>Confeſſion of Enemies,</hi> muſt belong peculiarly to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, or elſe 'twill do him no Service. For this is a Rule which the Cardinal hath laid down,<note place="margin">C. II.</note> that <hi>Notes muſt be proper and not common.</hi> For (ſays he) if I would deſcribe a certain Man to one who knows him not, I muſt not ſay he is one that hath two Eyes and Hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe theſe are common things, and he will never find him by ſuch common Deſcriptions as theſe. According to this Account we may juſtly expect that when the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal produceth the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of Adverſaries in behalf of the Church, he ſhould produce Witneſſes who ſpeak of that very Church of which he makes this Confeſſion a Note; elſe theſe Witneſſes prove nothing to his purpoſe. If they ſhould chance only to ſpeak ſome favourable words of Chriſtianity, or of ſome few Chriſtians, this will be ſhort of what they are produced for in this Place. And what ever good uſe may be made of their Confeſſion,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:104627:180"/>yet 'twill not belong peculiarly to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> They muſt ſpeak to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in her behalf, or elſe the Cardinal had better have ſpared them: They'l do him no ſervice, if they do not make good his <hi>Note;</hi> and that cannot be done if they wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs not in behalf of the Roman Church. 'Tis time now to call the Witneſſes, and hear what they have to ſay in behalf of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And here, not to invert that Order which the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal hath taken, we will begin with the <hi>Pagans,</hi> and ſee what they have to ſay in behalf of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Cardinal begins with <hi>Pliny</hi> the Second: He in his Epiſtle to the Emperor <hi>Trajan</hi> gives this Teſtimony in behalf of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> viz. that <hi>they deteſted all Vices, lived moſt holily, and were blamable on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count only, that they were too forward to part with their Lives for their God; and they roſe up before day to ſing praiſes to Chriſt.</hi> But what is all this to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> eſpecially as it is now conſtituted, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from other <hi>Chriſtians</hi> which are not of her Communion, and do not own themſelves ſubject to the Biſhop of that Church? He ſpeaks well of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and we allow that thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at that time were ſuch: We have no quarrel with the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the Roman Church who lived in the days of <hi>Trajan. Pliny</hi> ſpeaks well of them; He does ſo indeed: But what does he ſay? Does he ſay that they worſhipped Images, or that they adored the Hoſt? That they pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Saints, and made uſe of ſeveral Interceſſors? That they deſerved Favour, becauſe they came ſo near the <hi>Pagans</hi> in theſe things? He ſays no ſuch thing. He tells us that they lived well, and deteſted Vices; that they ſang praiſes to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and were willing to die for God. Did we ever find fault with any of the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:104627:180"/>Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for their good Lives, or the Hymns of Praiſe which they ſing to Chriſt? Have we ever quarrelled with them for deteſting Vices, or expoſing their Lives for the Honour of the true God? He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the Chriſtians that lived then, but not for any thing which they either believed or practiſed, which is now a matter of Controverſy between us and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Church of <hi>Rome. Pliny</hi> commends the ancient Chriſtians: Be it ſo: Why muſt this be reſtrained to the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Were there no Chriſtians but what were in Communion with, and were ſubject to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church? He commends the Chriſtians of that Time: But will this juſtify them who afterwards ſhall call themſelves by that Name? He commends them for their good Lives, their Love to God, and Gratitude to their Saviour: Will this juſtify the preſent Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Will it ſerve to defend the Worſhip of Images, or Prayers to the Bleſſed Virgin, and Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saints? Does it appear that there were no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in the World but thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that that Church was then what it is now?</p>
                     <p>What the Cardinal produceth afterwards, hath no greater Force than this Teſtimony of <hi>Pliny. Tertullian</hi> tells us that the <hi>Heathens</hi> would not hear the Cauſe of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> whom they knew to be guiltleſs, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned it at all Adventures; and that the beſt Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors favoured Chriſtianity, and that 'twas perſecuted by the worſt. All this, however it may ſerve the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Chriſtianity, does not make for the purpoſe for which the Cardinal does produce it.</p>
                     <p>The ſame may be ſaid as to what he mentions of the Efficacy of the Prayers of the Chriſtian Souldiers from the Epiſtle of <hi>M. Aurelius;</hi> and if St. <hi>Antony,</hi> St. <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larion,</hi> and St. <hi>Martin</hi> were reverenced by the <hi>Pagans;</hi>
                        <pb n="316" facs="tcp:104627:181"/>I do not ſo much as imagine what Service this will be to the Cauſe the Cardinal hath undertaken to defend, or what Prejudice 'twill be to ours. So that hitherto here is nothing ſaid to the purpoſe in hand, nothing ſaid but what the Proteſtants may as well apply to themſelves as the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His next Set of Witneſſes are <hi>Jews;</hi> if we examine them we ſhall only find that he hath wiſely made choice of two great Names, but that neither of them ſpeak one Word to the purpoſe: His Authors are <hi>Joſephus</hi> the Hiſtorian, and <hi>Philo Judaeus,</hi> two incomparable Authors they are, and by no means to be excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt. Here's the Miſchief, that neither of them have a Syllable that makes for the Defence of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the Prejudice of the Reformed. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver let us hear them ſpeak: And firſt let us hear what <hi>Joſephus,</hi> the elder of the two, hath to ſay: It is this, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was a <hi>wiſe Man,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jofeph. Antiq. Jud. l. 18. c. 6.</note> if it <hi>be lawful to call him a Man; that he was the Effector of wondrous Works,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that he was the Chriſt or Meſſias.</hi> By the way the Cardinal makes <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſpeak <hi>Non-ſenſe,</hi> as he reports his Teſtimony: For he ſays, not only that <hi>Joſephus</hi> does affirm <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be more than a Man, but that he was truly the <hi>Meſſias:</hi> Now <hi>Joſephus</hi> would never ſpeak at this rate; to affirm that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> is to affirm that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for the <hi>Meſſias</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> are the ſame. <hi>Joſephus</hi> affirms that <hi>Jeſus</hi> lived at that time which he mentions, and that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the <hi>Chriſt</hi> or <hi>Meſſias.</hi> But to let this paſs; I grant that <hi>Joſephus</hi> affirms that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the <hi>Chriſt;</hi> what is this to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> any farther than it concerns our common Chriſtianity? I would fain know why the Cardinal produceth this in behalf of his Church, or what reaſon can be aſſigned why Proteſtants may
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:104627:181"/>not as well apply it to their own. The common Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity is concerned in ſuch a Teſtimony, and ſo far the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is alſo. But ſet aſide that Conſideration, and take the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as the Cardinal does, as diſtinct from, and oppoſed to other <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that are not of her Communion, and I dare ſay I will produce Teſtimonies as pertinent as this of <hi>Joſephus</hi> out of any Page of <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Iliads,</hi> or the <hi>Commentaries</hi> of <hi>Julius Caeſar.</hi> For what Coherence is there between theſe two Propoſitions, <hi>Joſephus confeſſeth that Jeſus was the Christ, Therefore the Church of Rome is the Catholick Church?</hi> And yet this is in truth the Cardinal's way of arguing.</p>
                     <p>Let us hear next what <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi> hath to ſay in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Chriſtians of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Now it would be to me a wonderful thing to find <hi>Philo</hi> ſay any thing in behalf of thoſe Chriſtians, when he never once mentions the Name of Chriſtian in all his Works. Yet the Cardinal hath the Confidence to affirm that <hi>Philo</hi> hath written a famous Book of the Praiſes of thoſe Chriſtians who lived in <hi>Egypt</hi> under St. <hi>Mark</hi> the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt. After this his poſitive Affirmation that <hi>Philo</hi> had written ſuch a Book, as being ſenſible that <hi>Philo</hi> hath no Book that bears any ſuch Title, he adds the Teſtimony of ſome of the Ancients, that <hi>Philo</hi> meant the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and not any Sect of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turiators</hi> would have. I do not think it worth my while to examin his Antient Writers which he quotes for his Opinion:<note place="margin">Philo Judae de vitâ Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plativâ.</note> I will for once take it for granted that <hi>Philo</hi> means the Chriſtians of whom he gives ſo good a Character, under the Title of <hi>Therapeutae.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let it be ſo, What is this to the Buſineſs? Becauſe thoſe Chriſtians in <hi>Egypt</hi> were good Men, and ſuch as
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:104627:182"/>
                        <hi>Philo</hi> deſcribes them, muſt therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be the Catholick Church?</p>
                     <p>The next Witneſſes which the Cardinal produceth are <hi>Turks;</hi> He tells us that in the <hi>Alcoran</hi> 'tis ſaid that <hi>Chriſtans</hi> are ſaved, that Chriſt was the greateſt of Prophets, and had the Soul of God; and that the Sultan of <hi>Egypt</hi> reverenced St. <hi>Francis</hi> whom he knew to be a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and a <hi>Catholick.</hi> To what purpoſe all this is produced I do not underſtand: I am ſure it cannot ſerve that of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as ſhe ſtands ſeparated from other <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> And if it be a Teſtimony in behalf of our common Chriſtianity, then all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it as well as that of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Alcoran</hi> will do the Cardinal no Service, unleſs he could have produced ſome Teſtimony peculiar to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, or that might have juſtified the Worſhip of Images, Adoration of the Hoſt, the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, or ſome of thoſe Doctrines and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices peculiar to that Church.</p>
                     <p>The laſt Set of Witneſſes produced by the Cardinal he calls <hi>Hereticks.</hi> A Man would think the caſe very deſperate that needs ſuch Witneſſes. But yet I find the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does not diſdain ſuch as theſe, when they ſpeak of her ſide. But in the preſent Queſtion we ſhall find they do that Church no Service: The Subſtance of what the Cardinal alledgeth is what follows, <hi>viz.</hi> That an <hi>Arian</hi> King honoured St. <hi>Benedict</hi> a <hi>Catholick;</hi> That <hi>Luther,</hi> when an <hi>Heretick,</hi> owned that in the Papacy were many good Things, nay all that was good, <hi>e. g.</hi> The true Scripture, <hi>Baptiſm, &amp;c.</hi> That <hi>Calvin</hi> calls <hi>Bernard</hi> a pious Writer, and yet he was a <hi>Papiſt.</hi> That another <hi>Proteſtant</hi> acknowledgeth <hi>Bernard, Dominic,</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> to be Holy Men; To which he adds a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of <hi>Cochlaeus,</hi> who reports an Article of Agreement
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:104627:182"/>wherein the <hi>Proteſtant Helvetians</hi> write that they would diſmiſs their Confederates Quiet, as to their true, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted, and their Catholick Faith.</p>
                     <p>From all which I ſee not what he can collect for the Intereſt of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> We do honour every Man that is good in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but this does not infer that we juſtify all her Doctrines. We own that they have the true Scripture and Sacraments, but this does not juſtify their addition of Apocryphal Books to the Canon of the Scriptures, nor of more Sacraments than were owned to be ſtrictly ſo in the Antient Church We will allow that there have been pious and holy Men, of that Church, and are not ſcrupulous in calling them by the Name by which they are commonly known and diſtinguiſhed from others. Much good may do them with ſuch Witneſſes as <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Luther,</hi> who did to the laſt bear Teſtimony againſt the Corruptions and Innovations of that Church.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. I ſhall examin the Queſtion a little farther, and more eſpecially the Teſtimony of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I might make many Remarks upon what the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal affirms, that whereas <hi>Catholicks</hi> neither praiſe nor approve the Doctrine or Life of <hi>Heathens</hi> or <hi>Hereticks,</hi> yet theſe ſpeak well of them. I do not think the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſts</hi> the more <hi>Catholick</hi> for this, that they ſpeak well of none but of themſelves, and will allow Salvation to none but thoſe of her own Communion. I could name a certain Lord of this Kingdom, who was upon his Death-Bed urged to declare himſelf of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> from this Argument of <hi>Bellarmin, viz.</hi> That they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> denounced Damnation to all out of her Communion; whereas we <hi>Proteſtants</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Salvation as poſſible to ſome of them. But he
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:104627:183"/>anſwered the Prieſt that urged this, That <hi>he thought it ſafeſt to dye in the Communion of that Church that was moſt Charitable.</hi> A Man would think that <hi>Charity,</hi> which is an inſeparable Note of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and made ſo by our Bleſſed Saviour,<note place="margin">Joh. 13.35.</note> might have been allowed to have been a Mark of the true Church alſo.</p>
                     <p>That they do not commend <hi>Heathens</hi> the Cardinal affirms roundly, and yet 'twere no hard matter to prove that many <hi>Catholicks</hi> have done it, and that they might very well do it. For why may not <hi>Heathens</hi> be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for their Juſtice, their Fortitude, their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, Gratitude, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He tells us likewiſe the ſame of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> that the <hi>Catholicks</hi> neither commend their Life or Doctrine. Indeed they have little Reaſon to expect it from them, who are reſolved to ſpeak well of none but thoſe of their own Party and Way. And yet becauſe the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal lays ſo great a ſtreſs upon the <hi>Confeſſion of Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,</hi> and condeſcends to receive the Teſtimony of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks</hi> (as he is pleaſed to call us) when it makes for his purpoſe, I ſhall at leaſt produce on our own behalf as many Confeſſions from thoſe he calls <hi>Catholicks,</hi> as he hath produced of ours on the behalf of his Church, and thoſe alſo both with reſpect to our Lives and Doctrines.</p>
                     <p>And tho it be true that they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have blackned <hi>Luther,</hi> and the other firſt Reformers, as Men of flagitious Lives; yet there will be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them ſome who have given a better account of them.</p>
                     <p>I might give in a very fair account of <hi>J. Huſs</hi> and <hi>H.</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> from a Contemporary of their own Church, who knew them well, and converſed with them before they died. For <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> whatever
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:104627:183"/>the Romaniſts ſay of him now, yet certain it is that <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> who I hope will paſs with C. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> for a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, who lived in his time, gives a better account of him. In his Letter to the <hi>Card.</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Luther,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eraſm. Ep. l. xi.

                     </p>
                     <p>But their <hi>Doctrine</hi> is of greateſt Concernment in this preſent Queſtion. Let us ſee if any of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have made any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in favour of our Doctrine. And here I will not enlarge; 'twill be enough to produce a few more Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies, and thoſe more pertinent than what the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal hath produced on the other ſide.</p>
                     <p>The Doctrine which our firſt Reformers preached, was not ſo abſurd as 'tis by ſome repreſented: Many of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have ſpoken much in favour of our Doctrines. <hi>Eraſmus</hi> did ſo of many of thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines which <hi>Luther</hi> taught; <hi>The Things,</hi> ſays he,<note place="margin">Epiſt. l. xxii.

                        <hi>which Luther urgeth, if they were moderately handled, in my Opinion, come nearer to the Evangelical Vigor.</hi> And ſpeaking of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> he adds, that were he <hi>not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by ſo great a Conſent of the Church, he could embrace the Opinion of</hi> Oecolampadius:—He adds that he
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:104627:184"/>
                        <hi>found no place in the Holy Scriptures where the Apoſtles are ſaid to have conſecrated Bread and Wine into the Fleſh and Blood of the Lord.</hi> The ſame <hi>Eraſmus</hi> elſewhere does profeſs that he <hi>wiſheth that what</hi> Luther <hi>writes of the Tyranny, Covetouſneſs, and Filthineſs of the Court of Rome, had been falſe.</hi>

                     <p>For the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation,<note place="margin">See a Treatiſe of Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by one in the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome. Printed 1687.</hi>
                        </note> one of the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath given us an Account lately; he proves from many Doctors of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that it is not ancient, <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi> from <hi>Suarez, Scotus,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Cambray,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Cuſanus, Eraſmus, Alphonſus à Caſtro, Tonſtall,</hi> and <hi>Caſſander.</hi> And that 'tis not taught in the holy Scriptures, he proves from the Teſtimonies of <hi>Scotus, Ockam, Gabriel Biel</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Cajetan;</hi> and after all that it was not the Doctrine of the Fathers of the Church.</p>
                     <p>It would have been very fit I ſhould here have made an end, having conſidered every thing which the Cardinal hath offered as to this Note of the Church. But there is a late Writer (I will not call him Author) hath taken the Confidence to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Teſtimony of the Jewiſh Writers in behalf of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mr. Sclater's Conſenf. Vet.</note> and, which is moſt ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of all, he quotes the <hi>Rabbins</hi> in Defence of the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, which they are as far from aſſerting as he is from underſtanding them. The Cardinal was too learned and modeſt to attempt any thing of this Nature; but this Gentleman advanceth higher than he thought fit to do: What he offers ſpeaks
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:104627:185"/>nothing ſo lowdly as the Writers Effrontery and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, not to ſay ſomething worſe. Tho he thought fit to deſert his Mother the Church of <hi>England,</hi> yet it little became him to fly in her Face, and ſuborn a Rout of <hi>Jews</hi> againſt her. His Diſcourſe is ſo weak, that I ſhall beſtow very little time and pains about it; I ſhall however ſay ſomething to it that he may not think any Part of his Pamphlet unanſwered, and do heartily wiſh him Repentance for his Folly, and that he may learn Modeſty for the future.</p>
                     <p>And for my better proceeding in this matter, I ſhall do theſe things:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> I will briefly ſhew the true uſe and value of the Teſtimony of <hi>Jews</hi> as to the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall ſhew the groſs Ignorance (not to ſay Diſhoneſty) of this Writer in this Matter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſhall prove that the Jewiſh Writers are ſo far from ſerving the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they bear witneſs againſt it, and that alſo in this very matter of Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall conſider how far the Teſtimony of the <hi>Jews</hi> is uſeful to Chriſtianity. And ſeveral ſuch there are that ſerve the common Chriſtianity.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>Jews</hi> as to matter of Fact confeſs that there was ſuch a Man as <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that he wrought wonderful Works. They do in their <hi>Talmud</hi> and elſewhere men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeveral of thoſe Names which are mentioned in the New Teſtament, and are there mentioned to have been at the ſame time in which they are placed there. This is an uſeful Teſtimony, and ſerves the common Chriſtianity, and ſaves us the labour in our Books a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Jews of proving theſe Matters of Fact.</p>
                     <pb n="325" facs="tcp:104627:185"/>
                     <p n="2">2. They are alſo good Witneſſes as to the Number of the Canonical Books of the Old Teſtament, which were depoſited in their Hands. This is owned by Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Cajetan,</hi> who affirms that this is one Advantage we receive from the Obſtinacy of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cajetan in Rom. xi. v. 11.</note> that tho they believe not in Chriſt themſelves, yet they approve the Books of the Old Teſtament, and therefore thoſe Books cannot be ſuppoſed to have been invented by the Chriſtians to have ſerved their turn. This Teſtimony of theirs ſerves indeed the common Chriſtianity, but is ſo far from ſerving the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that it is a good Evidence againſt the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> who have receiv'd thoſe Books for Canonical which the <hi>Jews</hi> never received into the Canon of Scripture.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They are good Witneſſes of the <hi>Promiſe of a Meſſias,</hi> which is reckoned among the Fundamental Articles of the Jewiſh Faith. And this is an other Advantage that Chriſtians receive (as <hi>Cajetan</hi> well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves in the Place mentioned before) from the Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy of the Jews.<note place="margin">Abravenel. C. Fidei. c. 1.</note> They agree that ſuch a Promiſe was made, and that therefore it cannot be ſuppoſed either a Forgery of the Chriſtians, or a vain Belief peculiar on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. They are good Witneſſes where they interpret thoſe Texts of the Old Teſtament of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> which belong to that matter, and which are by the Writers of the New Teſtament applied to that purpoſe: And the more ancient <hi>Jews</hi> do thus. The Chaldee Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſts, and other of the more ancient Jewiſh Doctors do apply thoſe Texts to him, which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> alſo underſtand to be ſpoken of him: Of which, were it not too great a Digreſſion, it would be eaſy to produce very many Proofs: This ſerves the common Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:104627:186"/>greatly, and in our Diſputes againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> affords us very great Advantages.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Nor do I deny but that ſome of the Catholick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the Chriſtian Religion (I mean ſuch as have been always believed from the firſt Beginning of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity) may receive ſome Confirmation from the Writings of the moſt antient Jewiſh Doctors. But to produce them as Witneſſes, as this Writer does, to a Doctrine never received by the antient Church, is the moſt extravagant thing imaginable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall ſhew the groſs Ignorance (not to ſay Diſhoneſty) of this Writer in this matter.</p>
                     <p>His Author, from whom he borrows all his <hi>Rabbini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Learning, is <hi>Galatinus:</hi> He tells (if we will believe him) that he was <hi>always accounted a very learned Man:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Preface to</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſ. Veterum.</note> It would have been more to his purpoſe to have vouched for his Honeſty. After this he falls into a Fit of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; he is of a ſudden tranſported with Admiration, that the <hi>Hebrew Writers long before Chriſt's time</hi> (take Mr. <hi>Sclater</hi>'s word for that) <hi>ſhould have ſuch Notions; But the Wind bloweth were it liſteth,</hi> &amp;c. He might have ſtaid till he had been ſure of the matter of Fact, and then 'twould have been time enough to admire at it. But the Reader is to know that Mr. <hi>Sclater</hi> was mightily incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to believe in this matter with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or elſe <hi>Galatinus</hi> could never by his Arguments have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon him. This appears from his own Words after he had drawn up his Evidence from <hi>Galatinus;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">P. 27.</note> he tells his Reader that <hi>Galatinus thought</hi> (and I'le aſſure you 'tis hard to ſay what a <hi>Jew</hi> that profeſſeth himſelf a Convert to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does really think) <hi>theſe Prophecies and Interpretations</hi> (he might have called them Dreams and Figments) <hi>argumentative, not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:104627:186"/>the</hi> Jews, <hi>but a Confirmation alſo of the Chriſtian Religion againſt all Hereticks,</hi> &amp;c. But if you ask Mr. <hi>Sclater</hi> what confirms him in this Belief, you'le find him not hard to believe: <hi>I am confirmed</hi> (ſays he) <hi>by the Title-page of his Book.</hi> Of ſo great force is the Title-page of <hi>Galatinus</hi> his Book with Mr. <hi>Sclater of Putney.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Galatinus</hi> was born a <hi>Jew,</hi> he was afterwards a Convert to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and a Fryar; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to diſcover ſomething in the Hebrew Doctors to juſtify the Doctrines of the Roman Church, to which he had betaken himſelf. 'Tis certain that learned Men have repreſented him as a Man of no <hi>Sincerity,</hi> and have taken notice of his Falſity, and the <hi>Forgeries</hi> of his Book. <hi>Johannes Mercerus,</hi> a Man of ſingular Learning,<note place="margin">J. Mercer. in Job ii. 11.</note> and <hi>Scaliger,</hi> a great Judg, give this Account of him. And ſo alſo many others,<note place="margin">Scalig.

This Doctrine the <hi>Jews</hi> are certain cannot be true, becauſe if they are not certain of the Falſity of this, they have no Certainty of their own Religion, nor can ever be convinced of the Truth of ours.

                     <p>IF he be an unwiſe Builder, who pulls down what he intends to build up; then Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi> (tho one of the Maſter-Builders of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) deſerves not to be reckon'd one of the wiſeſt: For he muſt ſhut his Eyes cloſe, who does not plainly ſee, that he frequently defeats his own Deſign; by giving Notes, which conclude that Church to be falſe, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to prove was the <hi>only true</hi> one. Such, for inſtance, is that, which is now to be conſider'd, as ſhall in the Sequel of this Diſcourſe be made appear.</p>
                     <p>The Confutation of which cannot be difficult, ſince I find nothing in the whole Chapter that hath ſo much as the ſhew of an Argument. Whereas ſome of his Notes are guarded, with a pretence, at leaſt, of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:104627:191"/>Reaſon and Antiquity; this is expoſed naked to the Aſſaults of its Adverſaries, without ſo much as a Paper Shield to protect it. He tells us indeed many Tragical Stories of <hi>unhappy Deaths,</hi> ſome of which are true, ſome doubtful, and others falſe; ſome of Perſons who were deadly Enemies, other of Perſons who were zealous Defenders of the true Church: But had the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries been all certainly true, and had the Perſons who thus died been all of them implacable Enemies of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> yet what does it ſignify, unleſs he had alſo proved, That when a Perſon dies an unnatural Death, the meaning of it is, That that Church of which he profeſſed himſelf a Member, is falſe; and the Church he oppoſed, the only true one? But how unwiſe ſoever he was in the choice of his Note, he was ſo wiſe, as not to attempt the proof of this, unleſs the Citation of this Scripture may paſs for a Proof, <hi>Praiſe his People, O ye Nations, for he will avenge the Blood of his Servants, and will render Vengeance to his Enemies</hi>
                        <note n="(a)" place="margin">Deut. 32.43</note>. God will avenge the Blood of his Servants: therefore if a Proteſtant die an uphappy Death, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the <hi>only true</hi> Church.</p>
                     <p>But why did the Cardinal ſend out this Note, ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn? For a good Reaſon: becauſe no Defence could be found for it. But why did he then bring it into the Field? Becauſe he knew it was Popular, and might ſerve the Cauſe better than another, that was never ſo well fenc'd. For will not he dread to oppoſe the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who is perſuaded, that God will ſet a <hi>Note</hi> of Vengeance upon thoſe that do ſo? Will not he ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adhere to it, who believes, that that is a certain way to an happy Death? In ſhort, whoſoever can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to believe, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is by this Note diſtinguiſh'd from all other Churches, he will as
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:104627:191"/>much dread to turn Proteſtant, as he does to die the moſt prodigious ſort of Death.</p>
                     <p>But the Miſchief is, That however ſerviceable this pretended Note may be to them among weak and undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Perſons, it will do there as much diſſervice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe who are judicious and able to examine it: For when they ſhall once ſee, what a palpable Cheat it is; and in caſe, that it were a Note of the true Church, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath the leaſt Reaſon of any Church in the World to pretend to it, they will be thereby diſpoſed to break off from the Communion of that Church which contradicts its own Marks, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves to ſome other Church, which hath a better Title to them. For the effecting of which, I ſhall proceed in this Method.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>I. I ſhall premiſe ſome Things as preparatory to what follows.</item>
                        <item>II. Shew, that this can be no Note of the true Church.</item>
                        <item>III. That in caſe it were, the Proteſtant Church would be the true Church, rather than the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                     <p n="1">I. I ſhall premiſe theſe five Things as preparatory to what follows.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That by an <hi>unhappy End, Bellarmin</hi> means, That which is ſo in outward Appearance, to the Eye of Senſe, or according to the Judgment of the World. Such as a violent, or ſudden, or infamous, or any kind of ſtrange or unuſual Death; eſpecially ſuch in which there is an appearance of the Divine Vengeance. As to be devour'd by Dogs, or eaten up of Vermin, to be flea'd or burnt alive; for a Man to kill himſelf, or to be kill'd by his
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:104627:192"/>Servants, to be ſmitten by a Thunderbolt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In a word, any ſuch End, as either in its Nature, or in its Circumſtances, is not the uſual or common End of Men.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> meant this, not barely for the Note of a Church, but of that which is the <hi>only true</hi> Church. For ſince, beſides the common Faith, in which all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians agree, there are many points in which they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and by which they are divided among themſelves into ſeveral Parties, he ſuppoſing that no more than one of theſe can be a true Church, and therefore that that <hi>one</hi> muſt be the <hi>only true</hi> Church, his work was to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us with ſuch Notes, by which this <hi>one</hi> Church might be known and diſtinguiſh'd from all the reſt. And therefore,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Inſtances he produces of Unhappy Deaths are for the greater part impertinent, becauſe the Perſons were ſuch as were Enemies not to this or that Chriſtian Church as diſtinguiſhed from another, but to Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity it ſelf, and endeavour'd the total extirpation of it out of the World. So did the Emperors, <hi>Nero, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, Diocleſian,</hi> the Apoſtate <hi>Julian, &amp;c.</hi> And thoſe Hereticks, <hi>Simon Magus, Manichaeus, &amp;c.</hi> were not more oppoſite to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than to any other Chriſtian Church. There is nothing therefore in theſe Inſtances by which one Chriſtian Church may be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd from another; nothing by which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may be marked out for the true Church, rather than the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> or <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as thoſe direful Deaths of the Heathen Perſecutors, and Apoſtate Chriſtians, gave no peculiar advantage to the Church of <hi>Rome then;</hi> ſo they make much againſt the Church of <hi>Rome now:</hi> For if they ſignified (as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> would have them) that Church to be the true
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:104627:192"/>Church which was then oppoſed by them, it plainly follows that the Church of <hi>Rome now,</hi> is not a true Church, and that the Church of <hi>England is;</hi> becauſe the Church of <hi>Rome now</hi> is not the ſame Church it was <hi>then:</hi> it hath <hi>now</hi> another Faith, by which it is become another Church; whereas the Church of <hi>England</hi> is the ſame now it was at firſt, yea the ſame now that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was then; it having purged her ſelf from thoſe Corruptions, which have been ſince introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and reduced it ſelf to the Primitive Faith. Thoſe other Examples of Tragical Deaths, which if they had been true, would have been more to the purpoſe, ſhall be anon conſidered.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Obſerve, that the <hi>unhappy End</hi> of thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it, muſt be a Note of a falſe Church, if the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy End of thoſe who oppoſe it be a Note of the true. The Reaſon is plain; becauſe thoſe who defend it, in doing ſo, they muſt oppoſe that Church that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes it; if they therefore have an unhappy End, the oppoſite Church will have this Note of the only true Church, and by Conſequence, that Church they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend in oppoſition to it, muſt be a falſe Church.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Obſerve that from God's Judgments againſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons, nothing can be concluded againſt that Church of which they are Members. The Reaſon is manifeſt, becauſe God's Judgments upon particular Perſons are uſually inflicted for particular perſonal Crimes, as in the caſe of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu, Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira.</hi> Theſe things being premiſed, I proceed to ſhew,</p>
                     <p n="2">II. That this can be no Note of the true Church; which I might prove at large, by ſhewing that it is deſtitute of all thoſe Conditions which Cardinal <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>

But becauſe this Method hath been already obſerved in the Examination of ſome of the foregoing Marks, I ſhall therefore wave the Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges it would afford me; nor do I indeed ſtand in need of them, becauſe the Vanity and Falſity of it will be otherwiſe ſufficiently manifeſt, both by Scripture, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and Reaſon:</p>

                     <p n="1">1. By all thoſe Scriptures which declare, that <hi>all things come alike to all Men:</hi> That in the common courſe of Providence, there is no difference put between the <hi>Righteous</hi> and the <hi>Wicked,</hi> between him that <hi>ſacrificeth</hi> and him that <hi>ſacrificeth not</hi>
                        <note n="(d)" place="margin">Eccleſ. 9.1, 2, 3.</note>; and by a plain Parity of Reaſon, he that <hi>perſecutes</hi> the true Religion, and he that <hi>defends</hi> it; he that worſhips God aright, and he that worſhips him amiſs, or not at all, as to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Events, hath frequently the ſame Lot; As King <hi>Joſiah,</hi> the Reſtorer and Maintainer of the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and who ſerved the Lord with all his Heart, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame unnatural Death that <hi>Ahab</hi> did, who ſerved <hi>Baal,</hi> and provoked the Lord to Anger more than all the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that were before him. Nor was this promiſcuous Diſpenſation of Events taken notice of only by wiſe <hi>Solomon,</hi> but we find it long before af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by <hi>Job,</hi> that <hi>God deſtroys both the Perfect and the Wicked</hi>
                        <note n="(e)" place="margin">Job 9.22.</note>: Righteous <hi>Abel,</hi> the firſt Man that ever di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was a Proof of it; he whoſe Sacrifice was by God accepted, fell himſelf a Sacrifice to his wicked Brother's Envy.</p>
                     <p>Nor was it thus, only before the Law, and under the Law, but it continues ſo ſtill now under the Goſpel The Tares and the Wheat, though ſown by different
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:104627:193"/>Hands, the one by the Son of Man, the other by the Devil, yet as they grow up together in the ſame Field, ſo they are gathered and cut down by the ſame Reapers, by the ſame Sickle, and are not ſever'd, the one for the Fire, and the other for the Barn, till the End of the World.</p>
                     <p>Yea in plain Contradiction to this Note, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tells us, <hi>That there are juſt Men to whom it happeneth according to the work of the Wicked, and there are wicked Men to whom it happeneth according to the work of the Righteous</hi>
                        <note n="(f)" place="margin">Eccl. 8.14.</note>. And that not only in the Courſe of their Lives, but when they die too. For <hi>there is a juſt Man that periſheth in his Righteouſneſs, and there is a wicked Man that prolongeth his Days in his Wickedneſs</hi>
                        <note n="(g)" place="margin">Eccl. 7.15.</note>. The good Man is ſometimes cut off by an early Death, becauſe he is better than others; and the Wicked, whoſe Sins cry aloud for Vengeance, prolongs his Days in his Wickedneſs; and after a long and proſperous Life, hath an honourable Death and Burial; for <hi>I ſaw,</hi> ſays <hi>Solomon, the Wicked buried</hi>
                        <note n="(h)" place="margin">Eccleſ. 8.10.</note>; that is (as Cardinal <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jetan</hi> expounds the Words) in ſuch a pompous Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, as tranſmits an honourable Memory of them to Poſterity.</p>
                     <p>I grant, that the Notes of Divine Vengeance are in ſome Mens Deaths fairly legible. But then, as I have before obſerved, from God's Judgments againſt this or that Perſon, nothing can be concluded againſt that Church of which they are Members.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Beſides theſe general Declarations, the Scripture further aſſures us by a particular Inſtance, that a true Church may be without this Mark, and that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the true Church may have it. Thus the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was without it, and the uncircumciſed <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins</hi> had it, when the High Prieſt fell backward and
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:104627:194"/>brake his Neck, and his two Sons <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas</hi> with thirty thouſand of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> fell in one day by the Sword of the <hi>Philiſtins</hi>
                        <note n="(i)" place="margin">1 Sam. 3.</note>. Again, when <hi>Zedekiah</hi> the Defender of the true Church, was taken, his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles ſlaughtered, his Sons ſlain before his Eyes, his Eyes then put out, and he carried Captive to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and put in Priſon till the day of his Death: If this was then a Note of the Church, the <hi>Babylonians</hi> were the only true Church of God, for their Enemies had then the moſt unhappy Ends: So contrary is this Note to what we find in Scipture.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Nor is it leſs repugnant to daily Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Hiſtory of foregoing Ages. For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. All the World can teſtify that the ſame kind of Death happens to Men of different, yea of oppoſite Churches. That as dies the Chriſtian, ſo dies the Jew; as dies the Catholick, ſo dies the Heretick. That the Proteſtant and Papiſt <hi>lie down ALIKE in the Duſt,</hi> to uſe <hi>Job</hi>'s Phraſe<note n="(k)" place="margin">Job 21.26.</note>. That as they often agree in their Deaths, who while they lived, were of different Churches; ſo they often widely differ, who were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ſame. One hath a natural, another a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Death; one falls by the Hand of God, another by the Hand of his Neighbour; one goes off gently in a Calm, another is hurried away in a Storm; one lives out the Term of Nature; another is cut off in the midſt of his Days; one dies leiſurely, another is ſnatched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſuddenly; one finds a Grave in the Earth, another in the Sea, another finds none at all, but is expoſed as a Prey to Beaſts and Birds. This is ſo obvious, that it is needleſs to produce Inſtances for the Confirmation of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Whoſoever has any Acquaintance with the Hiſtory
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:104627:194"/>of the Chriſtian Church, knows, that for ſeveral of the firſt Ages at leaſt, the beſt Men had generally the worſt Deaths: That the Apoſtles of our bleſſed Lord were ſet forth as a Spectacle to the World, ſuffered the Deaths of the baſeſt Malefactors; that St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Andrew</hi> were crucified, St. <hi>James</hi> the Juſt ſtoned, and his Brains knocked out with a Club, St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi> flead alive: That not one of the Apoſtles can be named, who did not end his Life by an unnatural Death, except only St. <hi>John,</hi> who eſcaped it by Miracle, for he was caſt into a Cauldron of boiling Oil.</p>
                     <p>That the firſt Biſhops (their Succeſſors) followed them in the like Tragical Deaths: That St. <hi>Clemens</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was thrown into the Bottom of the Sea; St. <hi>Simeon</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> crucified; St. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antioch</hi> expoſed to the Lions; St. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarp</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Smyrna</hi> burnt at a Stake: Yea that the Chriſtians for the moſt part for three hundred Years together, met with the moſt horrid Deaths: One was torn in pieces by wild Beaſts, another was roaſted on a Spit, another was broiled on a Gridiron, another had his Fleſh ſcraped off to the Bones with ſharp Shells, and Salt and Vinegar poured into his green Wounds; and for one of their bloody Perſecutors, an hundred Chriſtians may be found who died a terrible Death. Theſe were the <hi>happy Ends</hi> that the firſt and beſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianſ were bleſſed with; happy indeed if we reſpect the Cauſe for which they died, and the bleſſed Reward they were crowned with; but none ever more unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in the Eye of the World. As they had been of all Men the moſt miſerable, had they had Hope in this Life only; ſo, if this Note be true, their Hope could not have reached beyond it.</p>
                     <pb n="342" facs="tcp:104627:195"/>
                     <p n="3">3. Nor is this Note more repugnant to Scripture and Experience, than it is to Reaſon. One prime fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Principle of Reaſon is, That Contradictions cannot be true; or, that the ſame thing, cannot be, and not be. This we are as ſure of, as that we our ſelves are, or that any thing elſe is; whatſoever therefore it be from whence it plainly follows, that Contradictions may be true, we are as ſure that it is falſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the Note now under conſideration is ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if it be true, the moſt palpable Contradictions will be true alſo. Of thoſe many that offer themſelves, I ſhall mention a few. As,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That that was a falſe Church, which was moſt certainly the true Church. For if the burning alive of <hi>Valens</hi> the <hi>Arian</hi> Emperor was a certain Sign that the <hi>Arian</hi> Faith is falſe; the burning alive of many of the firſt Chriſtians is as certain a Note that the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Faith is falſe. If it follows, that <hi>Manichaeus</hi> was a damnable Heretick becauſe he was flead alive, muſt we not conclude that St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi> was as bad (and by conſequence all the holy Apoſtles) becauſe he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſame kind of Death?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That a Church remaining the ſame, without any Change in Doctrine, Worſhip or Diſcipline, may be to day a falſe Church, to morrow the only true Church. So the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was a falſe one, when the High Prieſt fell backward and brake his Neck; within a few days after, when the Hand of the Lord was againſt the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and they were ſmitten with a foul Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, of which they miſerably died, it was a true Church again. Thus the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Year 1656, when a dreadful Peſtilence (for that is one of <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s unhappy Ends) ſwept away three hundred thouſands in three Months time, in the Kingdom of
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:104627:195"/>
                        <hi>Naples,</hi> and made great havock at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Genoa</hi>
                        <note n="†" place="margin">Athanaſ. Kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheri Scrutin. Phyſico-Med. Contag. Luis quae dicitur Peſtis. P. 426.</note>, was a falſe Church; but in the Year 1665, when the like dreadful Peſtilence raged in <hi>London,</hi> it became a true Church again. Yea,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That there is no one Church in the World, but by this Note, it may be, and it may not be the true Church; becauſe the Oppoſers and the Defenders of any one and the ſame Church, may have both of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, and both of them happy Ends. Now as the Oppoſers have unhappy Ends, it is a true Church; as the Defenders have unhappy Ends it is (by the fourth thing premiſed) a falſe one. Again, as the Oppoſers have an happy End, it is a falſe Church; as the Defenders have an happy End, it is a true one. Thus for Example, the Church of <hi>England</hi> is both a true Church and a falſe; Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> lived and died happily, the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> her and its great Enemies in 88, died unfortunately, therefore it is the only true Church: King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt of Bleſſed Memory, had an unhappy End, the Uſurper died quietly in his Bed, therefore it is a falſe Church. I bring the Church of <hi>England</hi> only for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the ſame is as true of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and, I doubt not, of any other Diviſion of Chriſtians of what Denomination ſoever.</p>
                     <p>And is not this now a fine Note, to find out the true Church by? when no falſe Church can be found, that will not by it be the only true one; and on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, no true Church can be mention'd, that will not be a falſe one. Yea, (which is more) when that which is indeed the <hi>only</hi> true Church, (the Church Catholick) will by this Note be no Church; for not only its Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but its Friends, too do often die unfortunately; and its Enemies as well as its Friends, have frequently ſuch Deaths, as in the Eye of the World are moſt happy.</p>
                     <pb n="344" facs="tcp:104627:196"/>
                     <p n="4">4. Whereas it is a Contradiction to ſay, That the <hi>only</hi> true Church can be more than <hi>one,</hi> if this Note ſtand good, it will be <hi>many;</hi> ſo many different Churches as there are in the World, ſo many <hi>only</hi> true Churches will there be, one only excepted. So when a Pope dies mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably (as all the World knows, the Popes have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently done), then every Church in the World, the <hi>Roman</hi> only excepted, is the only true Church; becauſe the Pope is an Adverſary to every one of them (and this, as appeared by the third thing premiſed, is made by <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> the Note of the <hi>only</hi> true Church). Yea,</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Thoſe very Proteſtant Churches which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> deſign'd to mark out for falſe, will by this Note be true Churches, and that which he would conclude the <hi>only true</hi> Church, will be a falſe one.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> he ſays, are not true Churches, becauſe <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> died miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly (that they ſo died, I ſhall preſently ſhew is falſe). But be it true, what follows? If <hi>Luther</hi> died miſerably, then the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> are the true Church: If <hi>Calvin</hi> died miſerably, then the <hi>Lutherans</hi> are the true Church; for <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> oppoſed each other, as well as both of them the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that he would make to be the <hi>only</hi> true Church, will by this Note be concluded a falſe one, I ſhall ſhew in ſpeaking to the next Head, and therefore now paſs it. I think by this time not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Vanity, but the Falſhood of this Note is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently manifeſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Let us now ſuppoſe it a Note of the true Church, and ſee who will have the beſt on't. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage will lye ſo clearly on the Proteſtant ſide, that the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves will be found to confeſs it.</p>
                     <pb n="345" facs="tcp:104627:196"/>
                     <p>I grant, That thoſe horrid Deaths, which have by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> been inflicted upon thoſe who have oppoſed her Errors, are a Mark by which ſhe is made as viſible, as her City ſeated upon the ſeven Hills; thoſe who have thus died are more than can be number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and their Deaths were many of them, both for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Circumſtances the moſt monſtrous: But this, I trow, does not mark her out for the <hi>Spouſe of Chriſt,</hi> but for that <hi>Woman that is drunken with the Blood of the Saints, and with the Blood of the Martyrs of Jeſus;</hi> She is not therefore, I think, ambitious of this Mark, but would rather hide it, tho it is ſo deeply branded upon her, that ſhe will never be able to rub it out. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe be ſet aſide, which I am confident the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is very willing they ſhould be, and would be glad if all Hiſtories were <hi>burnt</hi> too, in which their <hi>Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> are left on Record; let us ſee whether Church, the Roman or the Proteſtant, hath the faireſt Plea to this Note. This will be ſoon determin'd, by comparing the Deaths of their Prime Members, and Zealous Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and then conſidering on which ſide we find the greater number of ſuch as are unnatural, and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to Men.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For the Proteſtants. The chief Aſſertors of the Proteſtant Intereſt, are either their Biſhops and other eminent Paſtors and Teachers; or thoſe Secular Princes who have under God, been the great Defenders and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors of the Proteſtant Faith.</p>
                     <p>As for their Biſhops, and other eminent Paſtors and Teachers, they are without number who have died the moſt happy Deaths, ſuch as <hi>Jewel, Whitaker, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher, Hall, Morton, Jackſon, Melancthon, Bucer, Muſculus, Zanchy, Farellus, Beza, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſinus, Grynaeus, &amp;c.</hi> whoſe Deaths were not only placid and pious, but attended with thoſe
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:104627:197"/>lively Hopes of a Bleſſed Immortality, as recommended their Religion to its Adverſaries.</p>
                     <p>But it is not ſo much my buſineſs to tell you whoſe Deaths were happy, as out of that number, to ſelect thoſe that were unhappy. And I think we may take it for granted, that the number of theſe is very ſmall, in that their profeſs'd Adverſary who labour'd to make the moſt of every thing againſt them, hath mention'd no more than Five, (<hi>viz. Luther, Zuinglius, Oecolam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padius, Caroloſtadius,</hi> and <hi>Calvin.</hi>) Now ſuppoſe it true, That all theſe died as miſerably as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> would have the World believe: yet what are five to that numberleſs number, who have had the moſt auſpicious Deaths? Will not the Argument for the Truth of their Church from thoſe that died happily, as much exceed that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, from thoſe that died miſerably, as the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the one, exceeds that of the other? So that if the true Church be concluded by this Argument, it is ten thouſand to one, but the Proteſtant Church is the <hi>only</hi> true Church.</p>
                     <p>But what ſhall we ſay if the Deaths of all but one of theſe five be miſrepreſented? And what he ſays of that one, and two of the other (if it were true) be no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of an unappy Death? Whether it be ſo, or no, I ſhall now briefly examin.</p>
                     <p>He begins with <hi>Luther. He</hi> (ſays the Cardinal) <hi>died ſuddenly, for whereas in the Evening he was merry and in Health, and had provoked all that were preſent to Laughter, by his Jeſts, the ſame Night he was found dead</hi>

                     <p>But what credit is to be given to his Enemies, we may learn from thoſe monſtrous Tales they ſpread con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Death, not only after, but long before it: Such as that horrible Miracle wrought at his Funeral for the Conviction of Hereticks, which he confuted with his own Hand. And it is not unpleaſant to read, how
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:104627:198"/>they contradict one another.

                     <p>But that his Death could be no Argument that God diſapproved the cauſe in which he died, is evident; becauſe to the great grief of our Adverſaries the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion which they hoped would have died toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him, made a greater Progreſs after his Death, than it had done before.

<pb n="352" facs="tcp:104627:200"/>breed Vermine and Lice, and produc'd many famous Men who have died of this Diſeaſe<note n="(d)" place="margin">Vaſſeur Annal de l' E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſe Cathed. de Noyon. p. 720, 721.</note>. It muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be acknowledged, that the lowſy-Evil, is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a Sympton meerly natural, but a vindicative Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the Almighty, when, without any Reaſon in the Humours or ſtate of the Body ſufficient to cauſe that loathſom Diſeaſe, it appears to the Deſtruction of ſome notorious Sinner. Yet it is certain that this Diſtemper is naturally incident to humane Bodies, ſince Lice do ſeem to conſiſt (chiefly) of that Salt, which, together with other Humours does copiouſly breath through their Pores. This Truth may be reaſonably gathered from the Chymical Reſolution of Lice, and from their medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal Powers and Effects in ſome Diſtempers. Beſides that, I have been aſſured by a Learned Gentleman (much addicted to Phyſical Experiments) that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly having three or four days together viſited Glaſs-furnaces, attending on ſome Experiments there made, has taken from the Backs of the Glaſs-makers (after they had ſweated profuſely in the ſame Shirts three days together) a great quantity of dry Salt, which was caked on the outſide of their Shirts, and that this Salt being put into a Glaſs, and ſet two or three days in a ſunny Window, did all become a body of little creeping things like Lice. If therefore the Salt which exhales through the Pores of Mans Body be the matter of Lice, the conſidering Phiſician may give good Reaſon, why and how the Diſeaſe may be produced, as it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be, in Bodies firſt decayed, and diſpoſed to ſuch a Malady by other Diſeaſes, where the Putrefaction of Humours, and the Reſolution of the animal Salts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very great, and the internal Heat and Motion, which ſhould carry them through the Pores, being too little, this unctuous and ſaline matter ſtops in them,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:104627:200"/>and there ſtays long enough to be animated into Lice, which as ſoon as unlivened creep forth in abundance, and are ſucceſſively followed by dreadful numbers of the ſame Generation, ſo long as the Patient lives. But I ſhall ſay no more of the natural Cauſes from whence this Evil may ſometimes proceed; but ſuppoſing it now to be as certain a Token of the Divine Vengeance, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would have it, I ſhall ſhew theſe two things:
<list>
                           <item>1. That <hi>Calvin</hi> did not die of this Diſeaſe.</item>
                           <item>2. In caſe he did, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to triumph in it.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. That <hi>Calvin</hi> did not die of this Diſeaſe. This will I think be manifeſt: 1. By reflecting upon the firſt Author of this Story. 2. By conſidering what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, both Papiſts and Proteſtants (of unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Authority) have written concerning <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes and Death.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By reflecting upon the firſt Author of this Story. <hi>Bolſec</hi> was the Man who firſt told this Tale to the World, and not till thirteen years after <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Death. All the reſt, <hi>Surius, Lingeus, Leſſiuſ,</hi> &amp;c. are beholden to him for it. Nor do I wonder that they licked up his Vomit: but it may ſeem more ſtrange that Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſhould, if we conſider theſe two things:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That he was <hi>Calvin</hi>'s mortal Enemy. 2. That many Papiſts who have made it their Study to defame <hi>Calvin,</hi> are aſhamed of him.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That he was <hi>Calvin</hi>'s mortal Enemy. One main occaſion of his Enmity was this: <hi>Bolſec,</hi> having quitted his Habit (for he was a Carmelite Frier at <hi>Paris</hi>) turn'd Quack, and came to <hi>Geneva,</hi> where finding himſelf in no eſteem among the learned Phyſicians, he reſolved to
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:104627:201"/>ſet up for a Divine; for ſomething he delivered about Predeſtination, he was firſt gently reproved by <hi>Calvin;</hi> but he more boldly inſiſting again upon it, he was then confuted by him openly in the Congregation, expoſed to publick Shame, and by the Magiſtrate committed to Cuſtody as a ſeditious Perſon, and not long after by the Senate baniſhed the City. This publick Diſgrace he would never forgive <hi>Calvin,</hi> but ever after bore a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Hatred againſt him, though he durſt not openly proclaim it, till after <hi>Calvin</hi> was remov'd into another World, and out of a capacity of confuting his Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. This alone is enough, the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves being Judges, to overthrow the Credit of this Story. I might alſo add, that <hi>Bolſec</hi> was a neceſſitous indigent Perſon, and a Man of debauch'd Morals, and ſo every way qualified for the feigning of a story, which he was well aſſured would be amply rewarded.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. So groſs are his Impoſtures, that many Learned Papiſts, who have made it their ſtudy to defame <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> are aſham'd to quote them. <hi>Florimond de Rae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Calvin; From this Head</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as from</hi> Pandora<hi>'s Box, are come forth all thoſe Troops of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, all thoſe Legions of Miſeries, and thoſe Torrents of Blood, which have overflow'd the better part of</hi> Europe— <hi>He that would know all theſe particulars, let him read the Authors who have taken the pains to write them.</hi> And then quoting <hi>Surius, Bolſec,</hi> and ſome others in the Margin, he adds; <hi>I have on purpoſe omitted many things, for the fear I had, that Hatred had ſometimes more power over them than Truth</hi>

                     <p>Now <hi>Beza</hi> tells us, That after he had finiſh'd his Will, <hi>viz. April 26.</hi> (a Month and one Day before his Death) he ſignified to the Syndicks, and all the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:104627:202"/>that he had a deſire to viſit them once more in their Senate-Houſe, before he died, and hoped to be carried thither the next Day; they deſired him to conſult his Health, and ſent him word that they would come to him, which accordingly they did: After he had thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them for their Favours, and given them much good Advice, he gave to every one of them his right Hand, and diſmiſſed them weeping. <hi>April</hi> 28, at his requeſt all the Miniſters within the Juriſdiction of that City came to him, to whom after he had given an Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he likewiſe reach'd out his Right Hand to each one in particular, and ſent them away with heavy Hearts and wet Eyes. <hi>May</hi> 19 (and he died <hi>May</hi> 27) the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters being wont on that Day to eat together, a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was prepar'd for them at his Houſe, and he being carried to them, from his Bed into the next Room, <hi>I now Brethren</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>come to take my laſt Farewell, I ſhall never more ſit at Table.</hi> Before Supper was ended, when he required to be carried back again to his Bed-Chamber, he ſaid with a Smiling Countenance, <hi>This Wall between us will not hinder, but tho abſent in Body, I ſhall be preſent in Spirit with you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I need repeat no more; If this already ſaid be true, what <hi>Bolſec</hi> ſays muſt be falſe. And that this is true, every one muſt grant, (conſidering the time when, and the place where it was publiſh'd) who grants, that <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> was in his Wits; For he publiſh'd it preſently after <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Death at <hi>Geneva,</hi> where, if but one tittle had been falſe, every Citizen almoſt muſt have known it: If the Senators had not all viſited him, and the Miniſters all met at his Houſe, a few Days before his Death (as <hi>Beza</hi> reports) every one of thoſe Senators, and every one of thoſe Miniſters would have given him the Lye,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:104627:202"/>and proclaimed him to the World for an impudent Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor: Eſpecially thoſe who were <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Enemies, would have noiſed it abroad: Whereas not one, either great or ſmall was found, who contradicted one Word of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But we need not the Teſtimony of <hi>Beza,</hi> or any other Proteſtant; the Papiſts themſelves, even thoſe who have written much more than is true to defame him, ſhall be his Compurgators; For if they take no notice of this Diſeaſe, who, could they have found any colour for it, would have made the World ring with it, 'tis certain they took it for a Fable.</p>
                     <p>Now whoſoever will take the pains to peruſe the Book quoted in the Margin<note n="(h)" place="margin">La Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe de Calvin contre l'out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage fait a ſa memoire, &amp;c. Par Charles Drelincourt.</note>, he will find many of theſe collected to his Hands: But becauſe the Book is not in a Language that every one underſtands, I ſhall touch upon two or three of them. <hi>Florimond</hi> when he reckons up his Diſeaſes, gives not the leaſt intimation of this<note n="(i)" place="margin">La Naiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance de l'He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie. l. 7. c. 10. p. 888.</note>, <hi>Jaques Deſmay</hi> inſiſts vehemently on thoſe Diſeaſes <hi>Calvin</hi> was afflicted with toward the end of his Life, as <hi>Impoſtumes, Hemorrhoids, Stone, Gout,</hi> in ſhort no leſs than a dozen, and then inſults over him, making them as viſible Tokens of God's Vengeance upon him, as his ſmiting the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> in the hinder parts, and putting them to a perpetual Shame. Now can it be imagined that he would have omitted this could he have found the leaſt ſhew of Truth for it, ſince this would have flood him in more ſtead than all the reſt? I ſhall add but one more, <hi>viz. Jaques le Vaſſeur,</hi> who is ſo far from forgetting any thing that might be to <hi>Calvin</hi>'s diſadvantage, that he tells many ſilly ridiculous Tales on purpoſe to diſgrace him, and yet hath not one word
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:104627:203"/>of this loathſom Diſeaſe, or any thing like it. I think I need ſay no more to vindicate <hi>Calvin</hi> from this ugly Aſperſion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But let us now ſuppoſe it true, and ſee what the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will get by it.

                     <p n="2">2. I ſhould now proceed to the other part of the Charge, which is blacker and more frightful, <hi>viz. That Calvin invoking the Devils, died blaſpheming and curſing.</hi>
                        <pb n="359" facs="tcp:104627:203"/>But I need not inſiſt upon it, becauſe nothing hath been ſaid to expoſe the falſhood of the former, but what is as truly applicable to this alſo. If therefore the Reader pleaſe to recollect what hath been already deliver'd, he will find this equally confuted by it. Tho I might have added ſeveral other convincing Arguments, had I not already exceeded the bounds alotted to this Diſcourſe. But the Truth is, the Calumny is ſo broad, and naked, that it confutes it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>I think it is now evident enough, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can have no advantage againſt the Proteſtants, from the unhappy Deaths of their prime Paſtors and Teachers. For, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf pretends but to five ſuch; ſo I have made it appear, that the Stories he tells of theſe, are all of them, either plainly falſe, or impertinent. Happy Proteſtants! So happy in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that if it might paſs for a Note of the true Church, they need deſire to be tried by no other. And ſince <hi>Bellarmin</hi> in the next Chapter, boaſts of the miraculous Succeſs of the Papiſts againſt Hereticks; I deſire them to conſider, whether it was not at leaſt next to a Miracle, that <hi>one Luther,</hi> who oppoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to all the united Forces of the Papacy, ſhould live ſo long, and at laſt come to his Grave in Peace. It may (as I ſaid before) ſeem ſtrange to ſome that Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſhould abuſe the World by ſuch feign'd Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as he does; but let it be remember'd, that he was a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> and the Wonder will then be the leſs.</p>
                     <p>Among all thoſe Princes, and other Secular Powers, who have (under God) been the great Defenders of the Proteſtant Faith, the Cardinal has told us of no unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:104627:204"/>Ends; we may gueſs at the Reaſon, for if he could, we cannot imagine he would have ſpared them, ſince theſe would have been much more to his purpoſe, than <hi>Pharaoh, Antiochus, Herod, Nero, Domitian, Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Julian,</hi> and ſome others, which he has imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently enough alledged. Tho had he produced many Examples of this ſort, <hi>one</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> would have been enough to have put in the Ballance againſt them all. Having ſhew'd how much the Proteſtants are beholden to <hi>Bellarmin</hi> for this Note,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Let us now ſee whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can make as fair a Claim to it. Or rather, whether ſhe, which will needs be the <hi>only</hi> Church, will not by this Character be unchurch'd. To begin with her Church-Men.</p>
                     <p>I might inſiſt upon the diſmal Ends of Cardinal <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, Charles Caraffa, Caeſar Borgia, Angelot,</hi> and many other Cardinals. But becauſe if any Rank of Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them be exempted from this ſad Fate, we may in reaſon expect it ſhould be the Biſhops of <hi>Rome;</hi> who by their Flatterers are made, not only equal to, but in many things ſuperiour to the Angels, who cannot die; I ſhall therefore more eſpecially reflect upon them: For if we find that the Popes themſelves, not only <hi>die like Men,</hi> but have had many of them, the moſt unhappy Deaths, we may ſafely conclude, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will never be able by this Mark to prove her ſelf the true Church.</p>
                     <p>We have already heard the unhappy Deaths of Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> III, <hi>Paul</hi> II, <hi>Clemens</hi> VI, <hi>Leo</hi> X, and <hi>Clemens</hi>

                     <p>It were eaſy to obſerve ſeveral Circumſtances, in the Deaths of <hi>Morgan, Gardiner, Sanders</hi> and others, which Men would be apt to conclude, were ſpecial Indications of God's Diſpleaſure againſt the Cauſe; but it is needleſs becauſe the advantage of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, as to their Church-Men, is already ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſt.</p>
                     <p>I might now proceed to Secular Perſons, and ſhew that their advantage is as great, with reſpect to them. It
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:104627:205"/>was before obſerv'd, that the Cardinal has not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd ſo much as one unhappy Death of a Proteſtant Prince. There has been one indeed, here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſince the Cardinal's Death (I mean King <hi>Charles</hi> I.) But what is one, to the many (that might be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd) of Popiſh Princes? In <hi>France</hi> alone within the ſpace of threeſcore Years, we meet with no fewer than five, immediately ſucceeding one the other, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much as one happy Death between, <hi>viz. Hen.</hi> II, <hi>Francis</hi> II, <hi>Charles</hi> IX, <hi>Hen.</hi> III, and <hi>Hen.</hi> IV. I now leave the Romaniſts themſelves, to make the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which moſt naturally follows from the Premiſes; And for a Concluſion of this Diſcourſe, deſire them to obſerve the difference between <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Authorities and mine: Whereas what he reports of the unhappy Deaths of Proteſtants, he has taken it from Papiſts, and from ſuch Papiſts who were their moſt implacable Enemies: I have not ſaid a Word of the unhappy Ends of Cardinals, Popes and Popiſh Princes, but what I have borrow'd from their own Writers.</p>

                     <p>WE are now come to the Laſt of thoſe Notes, by which the Cardinal would perſwade us the true Church may be eaſily known. He had laboured hard to make them up ſo many; but he was reſolved never to leave raiſing of Notes, till he had his full Complement of Fifteen. And in this he ſeems to have been put to ſuch a Shift, as ſome Generals ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are; who finding themſelves in Streights, draw out their Front to a great Length, and fill up their Ranks with Suttlers Boyes, and other weak Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants on the Camp, meerly to make a Shew, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe the Enemy with a vain appearance of Numbers, when they have reaſon to dread the Iſſue of the Battel. It is certain no Man before him ever counted up ſo many
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:104627:207"/>Notes as he has done. Some he tells us make but <hi>Two,</hi> ſome <hi>Three,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Bellarm. de Not. Eccl. c. 3.</note> ſome <hi>Four,</hi> ſome <hi>Six,</hi> ſome <hi>Ten</hi> or <hi>Eleven,</hi> as they pleaſe, and one, he thinks, reckons up a <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen;</hi> which is the moſt that any ever durſt venture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, till he himſelf came on the Stage. And then he at laſt makes a new Diſcovery, that they were all ſhort in their Account; for that the Notes of the Church are juſt Fifteen. So that here muſt be Three at leaſt, pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his own, that were never heard of before; and for which they that like them muſt ſtand for ever obliged to Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s happy Invention. But then what a miſerable Condition was the Church in for many Ages! For if there be no Salvation out of their Church, as they of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Perſuaſion confidently affirm; and if this Church is to be known by certain Notes, as they endeavour to prove; and if theſe Notes be dubious and arbitrary, and often differing, according to the Fancy of their ſeveral Writers, as cannot be denied; then what hopes can there ever be of finding out the true Church, and ending the Controverſy this way? And if two or three Notes are ſufficient to determine the Matter, as ſome have thought; to what purpoſe are we troubled with all the reſt? But if the whole Number be judged neceſſary to make it evident; what a hazardous Eſtate were Men in, before this great Author had perfected the Liſt? And their danger continued a long time; for they were never acquainted with divers of theſe Notes, till towards the latter end of the Sixteenth Century.</p>
                     <p>But the Cardinal himſelf ſeems to be ſenſible of the weakeneſs of many of them, when he acknowledges <hi>That the Moderns commonly aſſign but Four;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                        <hi>and thoſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the</hi> Conſtantinopolitan <hi>Creed, where the Church is declared to be One, Holy, Catholick, and Apoſtolick.</hi> And theſe alone without the help of any other fictitious
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:104627:207"/>ſupernumerary Notes, are abundantly ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate that any Church, to which they do belong, is not certainly a true Church. And therefore to gain credit to thoſe he has thought fit to add, he tells us they may be <hi>ſome way reduc'd to theſe Four.</hi> But for my part, I do not underſtand how it can poſſibly be done. And not to mention any of the reſt, I will inſtance only in this laſt Note I am about to examine. <hi>Temporal Felicity</hi> (which he cautiouſly reſtrains to Succeſs in War) for ought that I can perceive, is not by any means <hi>reduceable</hi> to any of the <hi>Four.</hi> It will not evidence the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the Church; for if this Note be allowed, then <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Great, <hi>Solyman</hi> the Magnificent, <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus,</hi> and divers others were all good Catholicks in their time; and inſtead of One, we muſt have as many Churches, as there have been Fortunate and Victorious Princes in the World, that have fought for the propagation, or defence of the moſt different Religions. Neither is it any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Argument for <hi>Sanctity;</hi> unleſs to ſuch as can eſteem <hi>Gain to be Godlineſs,</hi> and account <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens</hi> Holy Men. Much leſs can <hi>Catholiciſm</hi> be proved from it; ſince good Succeſs was never known to attend always upon the ſame ſide; and the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Empire, whatever ambitious Men may dream, are never like to be the ſame thing. And leaſt of all can we from hence gather any Church to be <hi>Apoſtolical.</hi> The Primitive Chriſtians were unacquainted with the Glories of Worldly Triumphs. They ſubdued the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but it was with Spiritual Weapons: They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the remoteſt parts of the Earth, but it was by the Holineſs of their Doctrine, the Blameleſsneſs of their Lives, and the greatneſs of their Sufferings. The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did not march out to convert the World with Croſſes on their Breaſts, and Javelins in their Hands:
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:104627:208"/>One of them once drew a Sword in his Maſters Quarrel, but was preſently commanded to put it up again, with a ſevere Commination. So that I do not ſee to which of the <hi>Four</hi> received Notes this of <hi>Temporal Felicity</hi> can be tolerably reduced. I ſhall therefore examine it as it ſtands by it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>But by the way I cannot but obſerve how ſubtilly the Cardinal has endeavoured to ſecure this Note; which he muſt needs know was very liable to many material Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions. And at once to prevent them all, he tells us roundly, <hi>That Catholick Princes never adhered unto God heartily, but that they moſt eaſily triumph'd over their Enemies.</hi> This he very confidently affirms, but without any offer at a Proof: But yet this will furniſh him with an Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that may be always ready. For whenever any of thoſe Princes, which he calls Catholick, ſhall be ſhewn to have been unfortunate in their Adventures; it may be quickly replied, that they did not then <hi>heartily adhere un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.</hi> And the contrary may be aſſerted with equal Aſſurance; and ſo here is a Controverſy ſtarted, about a Matter of Fact, which all the Men upon Earth are never able to decide. For the Intentions and inward Diſpoſitions of Mens Minds are diſcernible to none, but the Searcher of Hearts. And how then can this be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be a Note by which we ſhould know the true Church, when the ſole Condition, upon which the Evidence of it is made to depend, is to us altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be known.</p>
                     <p>And this alone might be ſufficient to evince the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it; but yet I ſhall endeavour to make it appear fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by ſhewing.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. That <hi>Temporal Felicity</hi> cannot be eſteemed a Note of the Church.</p>
                     <pb n="369" facs="tcp:104627:208"/>
                     <p n="2">II. That the Inſtances the Cardinal brings, do not prove it.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. And that there are many Examples of <hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> as he accounts them, who have been as proſperous and ſucceſsful in the World, as any of his <hi>Catholicks.</hi> If theſe things may be ſeverally made out, then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is like to get but little Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by this fifteenth Note.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. And that <hi>Temporal Felicity</hi> cannot be eſteemed a Note of the Church ſeems evident enough, and that principally for theſe Reaſons:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe God has no where promiſed it in all the holy Goſpel; and it is no better than vain Arrogance, and a fond kind of Preſumption to make that a Mark of the Church, which is neither eſſential to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of it, nor yet inſeparably annexed to it by virtue of any Divine Promiſe. The <hi>Jews</hi> indeed were encouraged in their Obedience by the Propoſal of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Temporal</hi> Bleſſings; and if they did faithfully and conſcientiouſly obſerve the Law, they were aſſur'd of great and miraculous Victories over their Enemies. <hi>Five of you ſhall chaſe an hundred,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lev. 26.8.</note> 
                        <hi>and an hundred of you ſhall put ten thouſand to flight.</hi> But Chriſtianity which is a more Spiritual Religion, that is eſtabliſhed upon better Promiſes, and has more full and expreſs Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of everlaſting Happineſs than they had, has no ground at all to flatter it ſelf with the fooliſh Hopes of external Felicities and worldly Glories. I cannot find one word in all the New Teſtament, upon which ſuch an idle Imagination can be probably grounded. Nay, on the contrary, Diſtreſs and Afflictions ſeem to be the moſt ordinary Portion that our bleſſed Lord has been pleaſed to allot the beſt of his Followers in this Life.
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:104627:209"/>He told his Diſciples,<note place="margin">Joh. 16.33. 2 Tim. 3.12.</note> 
                        <hi>In the World ye ſhall have Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Yea, and all that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall ſuffer Perſecution.</hi> The Expreſſions are plain; and many more might be brought to the ſame purpoſe: And if they could all be warrantably reſtrained to ſome certain Perſons and Times, yet they would afford but a very feeble Argument to prove that <hi>Temporal Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity</hi> was a Note of the Church; and if any better can be produced, it is more than the Cardinal has done. His Error in this is very like that of the Jews, who anciently did, and ſtill do expect a Triumphant World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Kingdom in the days of their <hi>Meſſias.</hi> But they are far the more excuſable; for, as I ſaid, they had ſome Promiſes of <hi>Temporal Bleſſings,</hi> and ſo might have ſome colour for ſuch a Miſtake: But it is hard to frame any Apology for one, who profeſſes to believe in a Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Saviour, that ſhall diſtinguiſh his Church by the ſame Character which they did, without the leaſt ſhew of a Promiſe to ſupport it. It is to be fear'd, when he invented this, that his eyes might be ſomething dazled with Purple Robes, and Red Hats; or his Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy intoxicated with the falſe Glories of extirpating He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks by force of Arms.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But be that as it will; this Note muſt fail him again, becauſe for ſeveral Ages together the Church could not pretend to any ſuch thing as <hi>Temporal Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</hi> Three hundred years at leaſt, were paſſed over in nothing almoſt but continual Perſecutions. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity was made the common Object of the Hatred and Fury of the People; and wicked and inhumane Princes ſpent moſt of their Rage and Cruelty upon it. They rack'd their Inventions to find out new and exquiſit ways of Torture. The Priſons were throng'd with Crowds of Confeſſors, and the Theaters, and
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:104627:209"/>places of publick Execution were ſprinkled with the Blood, and ſtrewed with the Aſhes of the holy Martyrs. And a long time it was that theſe lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Spactacles were very frequent; and when they happened to have any little intermiſſion, it was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Refreſhment, than a Reſt; nothing but a ſpace of taking Breath, that they might gather ſtrength, and prepare themſelves for another Encounter. And all this while to be ſure the Chriſtians could obtain no other Victory over their Adverſaries, but by convincing their Infidelity by their patient ſuffering. Before <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> ſhewed them what it was, they were great ſtrangers to <hi>Temporal Felicity;</hi> and how often they have had it interrupted ſince that, I will not now enquire: but whatever this may be of the <hi>Roman,</hi> it is not a Note of the true <hi>Catholick</hi> Church; for that we know flouriſhed divers Ages, in the greateſt Purity without it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And if this be not Proof enough, yet the unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Miſeries which the Church of God muſt endure in the Days of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> is an undeniable Demonſtration that this Note cannot be allowed. The Cardinal himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes,<note place="margin">Bell. de Rom. Pont. l. 3. c. 4. and 17. Corn. a Lap. in Apocal. cap. 3.</note> and I think all the Writers of his Communion do generally agree, that the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Tyranny ſhall far exceed all the Cruelties that were inflicted by the worſt of the Heathen Emperours. This others believe as well as they; but then they conceive that ſome of theſe grievous Calamities may be already paſt in the ſharp and lingring Torments, the many dreadful Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacres, and the cruel and promiſcuous Slaughters of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times; which can ſcarce be parallel'd by any thing the Chriſtians ſuffered of old under Pagan Idolaters. But <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and the reſt of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for ſome Reaſons do imagine that all this is ſtill to come.
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:104627:210"/>But be it paſt or future, it quite overthrows the credit of this Fifteenth Note. For the State, which by his own Confeſſion the Church muſt be in during that <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Perſecution, is very inconſiſtent with <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Felicity.</hi> There is no ſtreſs therefore to be laid upon this; no Promiſe can be pretended for it, and the time has certainly once been, when it was not, and it is frankly acknowledged that the time ſhall come again when it will not be a Note of the Church.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. This might be ſufficient to put an end to this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute: But becauſe the only way the Cardinal has taken to confirm his Opinion, is by collecting ſome Hiſtorical Paſſages, which he thinks make for his purpoſe; I ſhall briefly examine ſeveral of them, and make it appear that the Inſtances he brings do not prove what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends.</p>
                     <p>And as for all thoſe taken out of the Old Teſtament, they were particular and ſignal Succeſſes conferred by Almighty God upon his Faithful People, according to ſome ſpecial Promiſes formerly made them, as I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated before; and they might be accounted ſubſequent ſigns of their Obedience, but not of their being the true Church; for ſo they were in all Conditions; as well when they were oppreſſed by the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> as when they drove the <hi>Canaanites</hi> out of the Land; as well in <hi>Babylon,</hi> as in <hi>Paleſtine;</hi> no leſs in the midſt of their moſt grievous Afflictions, than in their moſt proſperous and flouriſhing Eſtate. And after <hi>Jeroboam</hi> had made the Separation, the two Tribes were the true Church ſtill, and the Ten were the Schiſmaticks; notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the various Events of their Wars, and that the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory inclined ſometimes to the one ſide, and ſometimes to the other.</p>
                     <pb n="373" facs="tcp:104627:210"/>
                     <p>To what he ſays of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and ſome other of the Antients, it might be Reply enough to tell him, that their Succeſſes, ſuppoſing his Note to be true, would make nothing to the purpoſe he contends for: Becauſe, as has been often proved, thoſe Times were not infected with any of thoſe groſs Errors which the Modern Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has been guilty of.</p>
                     <p>But yet to ſhew what Partiality he uſes in the choice of theſe Inſtances, I will enquire a little into one of them. He tells us <hi>that a vaſt Army of the Goths of more than a hundred thouſand was totally defeated, in one Battel, and</hi> Rhadagaiſus <hi>their King, together with his Son, taken and ſlain, and not ſo much as one of the</hi> Romans <hi>killed or wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Thus he from St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> relates it.<note place="margin">De Civit. Dei. l. 5. c. 23. Oroſ. lib. 7. cap. 26. Paul Diacon. lib. 13.</note> Others ſay there was no Battel, but that this huge Multitude of above two hundred thouſand Men, or, as ſome make them, double that number, being incloſed among the barren Mountains of <hi>Feſula,</hi> were ſo extreamly weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with Famine; that <hi>Rhadagaiſus</hi> endeavoured to make his Eſcape alone, but being taken Priſoner, was put to Death, and the reſt became an eaſy Prey to their Enemies. This the Cardinal mentions as the <hi>Felicity</hi> of <hi>Honorius;</hi> and it was indeed a very wonderful Succeſs; but then it is almoſt the only thing that happened well in all his time. And, notwithſtanding this miraculous Victory, he was one of the moſt unfortunate Emperors of them all.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>See</hi> Procop. Vandal. 1.</note> He ſuffered the Capital City of the World to be taken by <hi>Alaric</hi> the <hi>Goth,</hi> without ever daring at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to relieve it; tho the Siege laſted about two years. But he was all that while very wiſely diverting himſelf, and feeding his Poultrey at <hi>Ravenna:</hi> And his Mind was ſo intent upon his Buſineſs, that when one of his Officers brought him the News that <hi>Rome was loſt,</hi> he had not a Thought of that antient, and formerly glorious
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:104627:211"/>Seat of the Empire, but imagined it had been nothing but a <hi>Cock</hi> he had of the ſame Name; and was much troubled, and mightily ſurprized that the poor Bird ſhould be dead ſo ſoon, that took Meat out of his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Hand but a very little before.<note place="margin">Procop. ib.</note> Beſides this fatal blow at the Head, that was ſo lightly regarded, many other Cities and Towns were utterly deſtroyed, the Country laid wholly waſte, ſuch Multitudes of the People moſt miſerably Butchered all <hi>Italy</hi> over, that it was but thinly inhabited for ſome Ages after, and this and other Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Barbarous Nations in thoſe days had ſo ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the State of it, that we muſt begin to date the Ruine of the Weſtern Empire from the Reign of <hi>Honorius;</hi> and he that can produce him for an Example of <hi>Temporal Felicity,</hi> may be fit to believe that 'tis a Note of the Church.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall paſs over the reſt of his Inſtances, till he comes to the Holy War: And there he takes notice <hi>how the Chriſtians being then about</hi> Antioch, <hi>with a ſmall number, and thoſe in great diſpair and a very languiſhing Condition for want of neceſſary Proviſions, and the Enemy at hand with a potent numerous Army; and when they were in this diſtreſs, it was at length ſeaſonably revealed to ſome Body where the Holy Lance was, which was brought into the Field in the nick of time and carried before the Souldiers, and three Holy Men appeared in the Clouds fighting for them; and by this means they unexpectedly got an entire Victory, with the ſlaughter of an hundred thouſand of the</hi> Turks. I will not queſtion the Truth of any part of the Story; but let any Man conſider the various Succeſſes of that War, and that it was concluded to the advantage of the <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,</hi> who remained Maſters of all at laſt, after ſo much Blood and Treaſure expended, and ſo many of the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt Spirits of <hi>Europe</hi> thrown away upon thoſe tedious
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:104627:211"/>and fruitleſs Expeditions; and he will be apt to ſuſpect that here the Cardinal did manifeſtly prevaricate, and that he had a real deſign to betray his own Church, and give up the Cauſe to <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this he boaſts of a notable Victory over the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigenſes; where a hundred thouſand of the Hereticks were totally routed by his Catholicks, that were not the tenth part of their number.</hi> It is true the Hiſtories of thoſe times do generally mention a very great Overthrow given thoſe poor People, in a Battel, by a very inconſiderable handful of Men under the Command or <hi>Simon Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:</hi> and that <hi>Peter</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> who came to their Aſſiſtance, was ſlain on the Place, and <hi>Raymond</hi> Earl of <hi>Thoulouſe</hi> forced to fly. And upon this occaſion, to ſtrengthen the Cardinal's Argument, as much as is poſſible, I think it will not be amiſs to call to mind ſome other of their glorious Victories over theſe <hi>Albigenſes.</hi> Theſe we muſt know were a ſort of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> that were ſpread far and near, and had a long time infected the Church;<note place="margin">

                        </note> ſome ſay they had continued ever ſince the days of the Apoſtles. Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to find a Remedy for this Inveterate Evil, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points divers eminent Preachers to go into the parts where they were thought to be the moſt numerous, and teach nothing there but the pure Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and endeavour by this means to convince them of their ſuppoſed Errors. But this way not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding; the <hi>Hereticks</hi> remaining obſtinate ſtill, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Diligence of the Miſſionaries; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks himſelf of a more effectual Expedient. Since Perſwaſions will not prevail, he is reſolved to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Terror and Force may not have a greater Power of Conviction, than Argument. Therefore he publiſhes a <hi>Cruſado</hi> againſt the <hi>Hereticks,</hi> as had been formerly
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:104627:212"/>done againſt the <hi>Infidels</hi> in the Eaſt; and ſets forth his <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Plenary Indulgence</hi> to all that ſhould engage in this Sacred <hi>Militia,</hi> and makes them as ſure of Heaven, as thoſe were that ſhould be ſent on his Errand to the Holy Land. Upon this extraordinary encouragement, great Multitudes flock together from all parts, and full of Zeal and Rage they march on, and perform many notable Exploits to the Eternal Honour of themſelves, and him that put them on that pious Work. In one City they put threeſcore thouſand to the Sword, ſparing neither Sex nor Age. And when the tender-hearted Souldiers found there were ſome Catholicks in the Place, they deſire to know, whether theſe might not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Quarter. The Pope's <hi>Legat,</hi> that was attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Action, commands them to make no Diſtinction; for fear a <hi>Heretick</hi> might eſcape under that pretence: And he excuſes the Severity of the Order with a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Expreſſion: <hi>The Lord knoweth who are His.</hi> This beginning was enough to ſtrike Terror into all that heard it; and then they go on valiantly ſtill doing great Execution wherever they come. Whenever any Town, or Caſtle was ſurrender'd, it was always upon theſe Articles; they that would be converted had their Lives; they that refuſed, were Hanged, or Burnt. After they had proceeded a while in this manner, <hi>Simon Mountfort,</hi> a ſtout Zealot, is by common conſent choſen General of the Pilgrims, (for ſo they were called) and appointed Commander in chief for this new kind of Holy War; with a Promiſe of the Government of what had already been, or ſhould happen hereafter to be taken from the <hi>Hereticks.</hi> He, armed with a ſufficient Power, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forces <hi>Raimund</hi> of <hi>Tholouſe</hi> out of his Dominions. The poor ejected Prince flyes to the great <hi>Lateran</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil for Relief; they, as if the queſtion had been about a
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:104627:212"/>Matter of Faith, ſuffer the Debate to come before them, and depriving <hi>Raimund,</hi> conſtitute <hi>Simon</hi> E. of <hi>Tholouſe. Raimund</hi> hereupon retires into <hi>Spain; Simon</hi>'s new Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſuddenly revolt, and force him to go himſelf, and ſend his Wife to ſeveral Courts to beg ſuch Supplies as might be ſufficient to reduce them to Obedience. But before that could be done, he is cruſhed to pieces with a great Stone out of an Engine, as he lay before <hi>Tholouſe.</hi> Soon after, his Younger Son <hi>Guy</hi> is likewiſe ſlain at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Town; <hi>Almaric</hi> the Elder, and Heir to his Father, highly inraged with theſe Misfortunes that fell ſo thick upon his Family, ſwears deſperately that he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver remove the Seige till he was Maſter of the Place. But notwithſtanding this inſolent Bravado, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to go away in a Diſgrace, aggravated with the Guilt of a preſumptious fooliſh Oath. Before this, <hi>Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> was returned, and entered again upon his Legal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and died at laſt in Poſſeſſion of it, and left the Suceſſion to his Son; when <hi>Almaric</hi> was fain to wander up and down the World, earneſtly entreating all that pleaſed to pitty his Condition, to afford him ſome Succours, that he might be enabled to endeavour the Recovery of what had been lately uſurped by his Father. And now upon a Review of the Succeſſes on both Sides thus far, the <hi>Hereticks</hi> ſeem clearly to have the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. And for what followed after this, it is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the particular care the Divine Providence has always had in the preſervation of thoſe diſtreſſed <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes;</hi> that could never be deſtroyed by the many po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Combinations that have been made againſt them, and the violent Perſecutions they have endured within theſe laſt five hundred Years; but in ſpight of all the Malice of their Enemies, the Remains of them, at this Day, are enough to exerciſe the Valour of another
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:104627:213"/>
                        <hi>Mountfort;</hi> if any unhappy Age ſhould chance to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce one.</p>
                     <p>For his <hi>Catholick</hi> Victories in <hi>Switzerland</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> if the Cardinal had been pleaſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us what they were, perhaps they might be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ballanced. However, for ought I can learn, the Proteſtant <hi>Cantons</hi> are in as good Condition as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I am ſure the Confederate Provinces of the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands</hi> are grown a very rich and potent Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and if they have thrived only by their Loſſes, then they may plead Miracles in Confirmation of their Religion; which he makes a Note of the true Church, as well as Success in warlike Adventures.</p>
                     <p>He juſt mentions a Victory of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth over the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> 1547; obtained, as he ſays, by a <hi>Divine Miracle.</hi> I ſuppoſe he means at the Battle in <hi>Mulberg,</hi> where the Forces of <hi>John Frederick,</hi> Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> were overthrown, and himſelf taken Priſoner. And I confeſs, it was a conſiderable Victory, but I cannot underſtand the Miracle of it. But grant there were one, yet it muſt be remembred, that afterwards <hi>Charles</hi> himſelf was driven out of <hi>Germany</hi> by a <hi>Lutheran</hi> Prince,<note place="margin">Thuan. lib. 10.</note> and forced to clamber over the <hi>Alps</hi> by Torch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, in a dark and rainy Night, among craggy Rocks, and ſteep and ſlippery Mountains, carried in a Horſe-litter by reaſon of his Illneſs. And when he had with great Labour and Hazzard overcome the Difficulty of the Paſſage, and was gotten pretty well out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the Fright had made ſuch Impreſſion upon him, that he ſtill conceited <hi>Maurice</hi> was at his heels: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that when he was met by the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, with a Body of Horſe, ſent by the Senate for the Security of his Perſon, he was afraid of his own Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, and could hardly be perſwaded that they were
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:104627:213"/>not ſome of the Enemies Troops. He was indeed a gallant and generous Prince, adorned with many He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roical Vertues, becoming the Greatneſs of the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter he bore, and had been often crowned with a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs anſwerable to the Reſolution and Bravery of his Mind; but this haſty and lamentable Flight loſt him the Fruit, and did ſomething eclipſe the Glory of his former Victories, and made him frequently complain of the Change of his Fortune. And being by this and ſome other Miſadventures he met with, made ſenſible of the Vanity, and grown weary of the Incumbrances of the World, he reſigned the Empire, and his other Dominions betwixt Devotion and Diſcontent, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into a Monaſtery in <hi>Spain,</hi> where he ended his Days. And this I hope might prepare him for an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, but it is no part of his <hi>Temporal Felicity;</hi> nor can it ever from hence be prov'd that that of which he profeſſed himſelf a Member, was therefore the only true Church. Or if it were ſo, as the Cardinal thinks, when he took <hi>Frederick;</hi> it was certainly otherwiſe, when he ran away from <hi>Maurice.</hi> And here I might conclude the Examination of this Note, for ſince he attempts to prove it no other way, but by an Inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Particulars; if he had failed but in one Inſtance, as I have ſhewn he has done in many, the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument could be of no force.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. But to illuſtrate and confirm the Matter farther, I ſhall bring ſome Examples of <hi>Infidels,</hi> and ſuch as he eſteems <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who have been as proſperous and ſucceſsful in the World, and gained as ſignal Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as any of his <hi>Catholicks.</hi>

A remarkable Inſtance to ſhew that Succeſs does not always attend the Papal Benediction.</p>

Cardinal <hi>Bentivoglio</hi> having given a full Relation of the whole Matter, reflects very ſenſibly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and tells us that <hi>there have been few other Deſigns that were ever longer in the projecting, few carried on with
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:104627:216"/>greater Preparations, and it may be not any after all more unhappy in the Execution.</hi> Hiſtorians of all ſides are perfectly agreed as to the Event. But thoſe that are unwilling to give the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Valour and Conduct any part of its juſt Commendation, impute the Victory to the Winds and Weather only, and it is readily granted that the <hi>Catholick Armada</hi> ſuffered very much by them. But that, and the Death of <hi>Sancta Cruz,</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Occurrences that might be named, are an undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Argument that the Divine Providence appeared vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly for the preſervation of the Proteſtant Religion. For this was looked upon as a Holy War, and many offered themſelves to ſerve in it upon that account. <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> then Pope promoted it vigorouſly, and talked or paying vaſt Sums of Money towards it; but all the Importunity that could be uſed, could never perſuade him to part with one Farthing by way of Advance. Yet, to ſhew his Good Will, he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted very freely in another way. He renewed the Sentence his Predeceſſours had paſſed againſt the Queen, depoſed her from her Royal Dignity and Eſtate, curſed Her, and all that ſhould dare to be obedient unto her, and very kindly gave away all her Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions at once. And in Proſecution of his noble De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, he ſent Dr. <hi>Allen</hi> a Cardinal's Cap, and intended to make him his Legat here in <hi>England</hi> to ſettle all, and reconcile the Nation to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Theſe things were ſo well known, that <hi>Strada</hi> the Jeſuit, after a Narrative of this lamentable Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, for fear it ſhould be made uſe of to the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of his Catholick Cauſe, as if Almighty God had manifeſtly favoured the Hereticks, in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all, effectually confutes this laſt Note of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi>'s.
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:104627:217"/>For when he had intimated what an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs it was to the Queen and Her Subjects, that they had not the good Luck to be conquered, as the Pope and the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had moſt lovingly deſigned;<note place="margin">Neque ſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis pios vendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare potuerint quia fortunati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ores fuêre; niſi forte, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

But then if good Succeſs will not be allowed to make for us, when it is on our Side; there can be no reaſon it ſhould be brought as an Argument againſt us, when it happens to be on Theirs.</p>
                     <p>After this it would be ſuperfluous to reckon up any more of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s <hi>Felicities;</hi> he that would undertake to recount them all, muſt write the Hiſtory of her Reign.

The Authority of ſo great and wiſe a Prince may be enough not only to ſecure her Memory from the malicious Attempts of envious trifling Pens, but to put the Happineſs and Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of her Government out of queſtion.

But poor <hi>Temporal Felicity</hi> is ſerved worſt of all; it has not the Honour to be ſo much as named, he has not beſtowed one Syllable upon it; though I take it to be as <hi>Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant a Note,</hi> as any of the reſt. But for all that, it
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:104627:218"/>was cunningly done to drop it; for he could not chooſe but be aware that the Hereticks might ſometimes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to a ſhare of it.

But really I am afraid that <hi>Theſe, Theſe NOTES, Theſe Triumphant NOTES,</hi> as they are by him drawn up, would be ſo far from being thought worthy of a <hi>ſecond Reading,</hi> that they would certainly be thrown out of the Houſe. However I have look'd ſteadily upon them, more than once, as they are repreſented by him, and as they are laid down in the Cardinal's Original; and I have not yet been able to diſcover <hi>the Majeſty one would think they carry in their Faces;</hi> but in my Opinion ſome of their <hi>Faces</hi> would have been a great deal better, if they had had any Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads. I have carefully beheld <hi>their Majeſtick Train</hi> in its full length, and yet never fell in a Swoon, <hi>with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba's Queen;</hi> nay, I have not had ſo much as the leaſt Qualm of Fear or Admiration upon me; and my Eyes were ſo far from being <hi>dazled</hi> at the Sight, that they were no more affected, than if I had looked on a Piece of Green Silk. But I doubt he will cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them very hardly for it; and think they are a ſort of <hi>malignant</hi> Cavaleeriſh <hi>Eyes.</hi> I can't help that: but whatever Eyes they be, ſince I have been able to hold them open ſo long againſt the glaring ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Splendor of <hi>Theſe, Theſe Triumphant NOTES,</hi> I will venture to draw out the whole <hi>Train</hi> once
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:104627:219"/>more, and give a little Remark upon every one of them, as they paſs by.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>The Name of Catholick:</hi> This is a Note which may be eaſily uſurped by every bold Pretender; but till it can be proved that it is joyned with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the true Faith, the <hi>Name</hi> alone is nothing but an empty and inſignificant Sound.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Antiquity:</hi> I ſhall not here mention the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> of ſome Errors, nor that there were many Churches in the World before there was any at <hi>Rome;</hi> but will freely confeſs that that had been ancient e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, if it had preſerved that Doctrine in its Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which it received at the firſt. But it is well known, that the Additions ſhe has made unto that concerning Infallibility, Images, Purgatory, and the like, cannot be pretended to be of Antient and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Tradition. Nay many of their preſent Tenents were never declared neceſſary till the laſt Age; and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it is now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, can be eſteemed no older than the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> that is, about fourty Years younger than the Reformation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Duration:</hi> By this the Cardinal would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us, that his true Church has been from the Beginning, and ſhall continue to the End of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity: The firſt we deny; the ſecond can never be proved till the Day of Judgment. We are ſure the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has been changed already from what it was; and we hope and believe that it will be changed again from what it is. And then what would
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:104627:219"/>become of the <hi>Duration</hi> they boaſt of, if they ſhould ever reform themſelves from thoſe Errors and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes which have crept in among them; as has been often attempted, and a long time moſt earneſtly deſired by many of the beſt and moſt impartial of their own Communion? So that granting this to be a Note, it would make againſt them both ways. For what is paſt, we know what Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have been made by them; and they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſecured againſt others that may happen here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Amplitude, or Multitude and Variety of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</hi> This can by no means be made a Note of the Church; for the time was once that Chriſt's Flock was a <hi>little Flock;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 1.15.</note> 
                        <hi>and the number of the Names together were</hi> but <hi>about an hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> And afterwards the Arrian Hereſy had almoſt overſpread the Face of Chriſtendom; inſomuch that the whole World was thought to be againſt <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius,</hi> and <hi>Athanaſius</hi> againſt the whole World. Or ſhould we let it paſs for a Note, they could gain but little by it. For they are infinitely exceeded in <hi>Multitude,</hi> not only by <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Mahometans,</hi> but by Chriſtians of other Denominations.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Succeſſion of Biſhops.</hi> How far this may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Being of a Church, I need not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. But the uninterrupted <hi>Succeſſion</hi> they of <hi>Rome</hi> are wont to glory in, is manifeſtly falſe: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the long Vacances that have ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and the many Schiſms they have had, when two or more have pretended to the Papacy, and no
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:104627:220"/>Man could determine who had the Right, which muſt make it dubious; the confeſſed Hereticks that have poſſeſſed themſelves of the Infallible Chair, muſt quite cut off, at leaſt interrupt the <hi>Succeſſion.</hi> Or if they have it, notwithſtanding this, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Objection that might be made. We of the Church of <hi>England</hi> can plead the ſame.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Agreement in Doctrine with the Primitive Church.</hi> This is a good Note indeed, if they mean the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Primitive Church;</hi> for that <hi>agreed</hi> with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Apoſtles. But then I hope they will not have the Confidence to affirm that their Prayers in an Unknown Tongue, their Half-Communion, their Adoration of the Hoſt, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things which they now receive, are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Practice and Belief of that <hi>Primitive Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the Members among themſelves, and with the Head.</hi> Of this they are continually making their Brags; but the many and violent Contentions that have often been betwixt the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pretenders to the Papal Dignity: and the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Feuds and Animoſities that are kept up amongſt them about many Controverted Points, do ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare that their Church has been rent and torn with Factions and Inteſtine Diviſions, as much as any other Society. Or if they were as firmly <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> as they pretend, it is no more than other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations of Men have been in known and wicked Errors.</p>
                     <pb n="393" facs="tcp:104627:220"/>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Sanctity of Doctrine:</hi> For they generally aſſert, as the Cardinal does here, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church maintains nothing that is Falſe, either in Matter of Faith, or Manners. If they were able to prove this, there might be ſome Reaſon indeed that their Church ſhould be eſteemed the <hi>Mother and Miſtreſs of all Churches,</hi> as ſhe has been wont, of late, to ſtile her ſelf. But ſince the Power of depoſing Princes has been openly aſſumed, and frequently practiſed, and never yet condemned by any either Pope or Council; ſince the Doctrine of <hi>Aequivocation,</hi> and many other abſurd and impious Opinions, are taught by their Caſuiſts, and made uſe of by their Confeſſors, in directing the Conſciences of their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents; and ſince theſe, and many more very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Errors, do not only eſcape without a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but are approved of, and incouraged by their Governours; I do not ſee how they, and their Church can poſſibly be excuſed from the Guilt of them.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>The Efficacy of Doctrine.</hi> Here we are told of the wonderful Succeſs they have had in the Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of their Faith, and the Converſions that have been made of whole Nations. And ſuppoſing it were as they ſay; yet Hereſy and Infidelity has of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten had as great, and ſwift a Progreſs in the World, as any that their <hi>Doctrine</hi> can boaſt of; and conſidering the Pravity and Corruption of Human Nature, it is not ſtrange, that the moſt groſs and pernicious Errors ſhould be more readily received, and ſpread themſelves faſter, than the moſt divine, and ſacred Truths.</p>
                     <pb n="394" facs="tcp:104627:221"/>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Holineſs of Life.</hi> This is indeed the moſt real Commendation of a Chriſtian; and I will not go about to rob them of the Glory of it. But then it cannot be denied, but meet Philoſophers, and ſome of the Antient, and many of thoſe whom they account Modern Hereticks, have been of a very ſtrict and unblamable Converſation; and divers of their Popes, and other Eccleſiaſticks of the greateſt Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of Place, have been very infamous for all ſorts of Wickedneſs, and Debauchery; and their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Religious Orders have been often complained of, for the neglect of their Diſcipline, and looſneſs of their Lives; as is abundantly teſtified by their own Authors.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. <hi>The Glory of Miracles.</hi> Theſe alone were never a Note of the true Church. And thoſe extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Gifts which were beſtowed at firſt, for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of Chriſtianity, we think they are ceaſed long ago. But we are forewarned of <hi>Falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 24.24.</note> 
                        <hi>which ſhould ſhew great Signs and Wonders;</hi> which me-thinks ſhould make a Church very careful how they made any pretenſion to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</hi> But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is reſolved to do it, and would fain perſwade us that there are many great Ones wrought among them to this very Day, and, as they believe, always will be. But we know, and they will not deny it, that many of the <hi>Miracles,</hi> they have talked of, are meer Forgeries, and Deluſions; others altogether incredible, and but weakly atteſted, and wholly unworthy of the Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Gravity of the Chriſtian Religion;
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:104627:221"/>moſt of them ſaid to be done in Corners, and are never to be ſeen, but among themſelves: When they pleaſe to oblige us Proteſtants, with the ſight of a few of them, they may then deſerve to be farther conſidered; till that be done, they muſt give us leave to think, that their Church is redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to great Streights, when it ſhall ſtand in need of ſuch ſlight Artifices, as theſe, to ſupport it.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. <hi>The Light of Prophecy.</hi> This, if they had it, can bring no more Advantage to their Cauſe, than the other. The Church of God anciently, when extraordinary Revelations were more common, had not always Prophets in it. And when any appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Prophet was to be tryed by the Faith of the Church, and not the Church by the Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Prophet. And we are ſtill commanded to <hi>try the Spirits whether they are of God:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.1.</note> 
                        <hi>Becauſe many falſe Prophets are gone out into the World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">13. <hi>The Confeſſion of Adverſaries:</hi> This, if the Cardinal's Inſtances were pertinent, would yet be but of little Conſequence; for if ſome Proteſtants have ſpoken favourably of his Catholicks, ſome of his Catholicks have ſpoken favourably of Proteſtants. Or if we ſhould be willing to hope well of ſome of them, as we are; and they ſhould adjudge us every one to Eternal Damnation, as they generally do; this would be but an ill ſign that their Church muſt therefore be the truer, becauſe it is more Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious, and Uncharitable than Ours.</p>
                     <pb n="396" facs="tcp:104627:222"/>
                     <p n="14">14. <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappy End of the Church's Enemies:</hi> A wiſe Man would be ſomething afraid of paſſing this into a Note, before he was himſelf ſafe in his Grave. <hi>For all things come alike to all:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eccl. 9.2.</note> 
                        <hi>there is one Event to the Righteous, and to the Wicked.</hi> Many of the moſt Zealous Patrons of the Romiſh Perſuaſion, have met with as Tragical and Unfortunate Ends, as the moſt accurſed Heretick that ever was devoured by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, or burnt at a Stake.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. <hi>Temporal Felicity.</hi> This may be placed in the ſame Rank with the former; it is altogether as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable, and inconſtant as that; no certain Judgment can be made upon it. They are not to learn that the Enemies of their Church have been often ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful: and that Victory has not always waited up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Catholick Arms; no, not in their moſt Holy Wars; when Religion has been the only ground of the Quarrel.</p>
                     <p>Thus upon a Review of all the Notes in order, as they are muſtered up by the great Cardinal, it may appear to any unprejudiced Enquirer, that he has miſſed of his Aim: For that they are either no Notes of a Church at all, or not proper to that of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now after the higheſt Pretences of an Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Church, and the abſolute Deference and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion which they ſay is due unto it, any Man, that ſhall ſeriouſly conſider the Matter, muſt needs wonder, they ſhould have no ſurer means at laſt to
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:104627:222"/>find it out, than a few ſlight and improbable, nay ſome of them very vain, falſe, and extravagant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures. The Proteſtants, whom they will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to be certain of any thing, have far better E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences than theſe, and as good Aſſurances of the Truth of their Church as can be deſired. For we think the True Faith, True Worſhip, and a Right Adminiſtration of the Sacraments do unqueſtionably make a True Church. Theſe the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves cannot deny to be the great and neceſſary Notes; and if the Controverſy betwixt us come to be determined by theſe, it will ſoon appear which Communion we ought to prefer.</p>
                     <p>We make Profeſſion of the whole Catholick Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick Faith, as it is contained in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and briefly comprized in the three Creeds; which is all that was ever received in the Primitive Church: They have made large Additions to the Antient Belief, and increaſed the number of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles from Twelve to Four and Twenty; many of which were not ſo much as heard of in the Firſt Ages, and never made neceſſary to be believed, till above fifteen hundred Years after the Publication of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>We Worſhip Almighty God, and none but him; and unto him we Pray in a Language we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, through Jeſus Chriſt our only Mediator, in whoſe Name when we ask, we are ſure to be heard: They have a kind of Worſhip which they give to Saints and Images, which as to all External Acts of Adoration, is the very ſame they pay to God
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:104627:223"/>himſelf; and when their Addreſſes are directed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Him, all their Publick Service is in an unknown Tongue; and they ſet up to themſelves many Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatours of Interceſſion, when they cannot tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they hear them; but it is moſt certain that God has never promiſed to hear them for their Sakes.</p>
                     <p>We receive the two Sacraments which Chriſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in his Church, and adminiſter them both in ſuch Manner and Form as he has appointed: They without any Divine Authority, have made Seven Sacraments; and in the Lord's Supper they believe that there is offered up a proper Propitiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the Living and the Dead; they adore the Elements which they think are Tranſubſtantiated into the Body and Blood of our Saviour; and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Laity to communicate but in one kind, robbing them of the Cup, contrary to the plain Inſtitution, and expreſs Command of our Bleſſed Lord.</p>
                     <p>And ſince we have the True Faith, True Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the Sacraments rightly Adminiſtred, it is evident that we are not deficient in any thing that is neceſſary to the Conſtitution of a True Church. But They will never be able to prove themſelves ſuch a One, by the late Additions they have made to the Creed, and their many Deviations from the Primitive Rule. And yet they will be continually vaunting that they are not only a True Church, but the only True Church in the World; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Preſumption they thunder out their Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema's
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:104627:223"/>upon all Chriſtendom beſides, and confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemn them for a Company of Heretical and Schiſmatical Conventicles. But they cannot juſtify that raſh and uncharitable Sentence, nor make good any part of this heavy Charge. For we that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily believe all the Antient Creeds, cannot be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of Hereſy; neither are we guilty of Schiſm, becauſe we only Reformed thoſe Errors and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which they had introduced, and wanted not ſufficient Authority for what was done. But if they are ſtill abſolutely reſolved to ſtand to the Cenſure they have paſſed, and allow no True Church upon Earth, but their Own; it is not Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Fifteen Notes that will ever prove it.</p>
